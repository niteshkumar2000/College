Here' s my day so far : went to jail , lost the girl of my dreams , and got my butt kicked pretty good . Still , things could be a lot worse . Oh , that' s right . I' m falling to my death . Guess they can' t . How' d it all come to this , you ask ? My end starts at the beginning . The very beginning . Yes , that' s me . I had a fairly standard childhood .\par
I came from , what you might call , a broken home . Literally broken . I was eight days old and still living with my parents . How sad is that ? Clearly it was time to move on . Here is your minion . He will take care of you . And here is your binky . You are destined for \'e2\'80\'a6 I didn' t quite hear that last part , but it sounded important . \'e2\'80\'a6 two , one . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Destined for what ?\par
I set out to find my destiny . Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea . That was the day I met Mr Goody Two- Shoes \'e2\'80\'a6 and our glorious rivalry was born . Could this be what I was destined for ? A dream life filled with luxury . Apparently not . Even fate picks its favorites . No big deal . A much different fate awaited me . A baby !\par
How thoughtful . Oh , yes . Yes , I saw it and thought of you . Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home . Can we keep it ? A place that taught me the differences between right \'e2\'80\'a6 and wrong . Mr Goody Two- Shoes , on the other hand , had life handed to him on a silver platter . Our baby can fly . Yes , yes , nothing but the best for you , darling . The power of flight , invulnerability , and great hair .\par
But I had something far , far greater . My amazing intellect \'e2\'80\'a6 and knack for building objects of mayhem . After a few years , and with some time off for good behavior , I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning \'e2\'80\'a6 at a strange place called shool . It was there that I once again ran into Mr Goody Two- Shoes . He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies . He bought their affections with showmanship and extravagant gifts of deliciousness . So I , too , will make this popp- ed corn and win over those mindless drones . Lights out . That' s when I learned a very hard lesson :\par
Good receives all the praise and adulation , while evil is sent to quiet- time in the corner . So fitting in wasn' t really an option . While they were learning the Itsy Bitsy Spider \'e2\'80\'a6 I learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will . Some days , it felt like it was just me and Minion against the world . No matter how hard I tried , I was always the odd man out , the last one picked , the screw- up , the black sheep \'e2\'80\'a6 Get him ! \'e2\'80\'a6 the bad boy . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Freak ! Was this my destiny ? Wait , maybe it was .\par
Being bad is the one thing I' m good at . Then it hit me : If I was the bad boy , then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all . I was destined to be a super- villain , and we were destined to be rivals . The die had been cast , and so began an enduring , epic , lifelong career . And I loved it . Our battles quickly got more elaborate . He would win some . I would almost win others . He took the name Metro Man , defender of Metrocity .\par
I decided to pick something a little more humble : Megamind \'e2\'80\'a6 incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy . Read on your own time . Open up . Oh , good morning , Warden . Great news : I' m a changed man , and \'e2\'80\'a6 and I' m ready to re- enter society as a solid citizen . You' re a villain , and you' il always be a villain . You' il never change , and you' il never leave . You' re fun .\par
You got a present in the mail . Is it a puppy ? From Metro Man . \'e2\'80\'9c To count every second of your 85 life sentences . \'e2\'80\'9d That' s funny . Never thought Metro Man was the gloating type . Oh , but he does have nice taste . I think I' il keep it . Any chance you could give me the time ? I don' t want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man Museum . Oh no .\par
Looks like you' re gonna miss it , by several thousand years . Oh , am I ? Happy Metro Man Day , Metro City . It' s a beautiful day in beautiful downtown , where we' re here to honor a beautiful man , Metro Man . His heart is an ocean that' s inside a bigger ocean . For years he' s been watching us with his super- vision , saving us with his super- strength and caring for us with his super- heart . Now it' s our turn to give something back . This is Roxanne Ritchi , reporting live from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum . OK , the stuff they make you read on- air , that' s un- freaking- believable . It' s crazy .\par
I wrote that piece myself , Hal . What I was trying to say was , I can' t believe that in our modern society , they let , like , actual art get onto the news . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Nice save , Hal . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What are we \'e2\'80\'a6 Like , let' s just get a coffee or something . Come on , it' s time to get in the Metro Man Day spirit . Well , if I were Metro Man , Megamind wouldn' t be kidnapping you all the time . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  That' s the first thing . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  That' s sweet , Hal . And I' d be watching you , like a dingo watches a human baby . OK , that sounded \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  OK , that sounded a little weird . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  A little bit . The point is , I would watch you like someone \'e2\'80\'a6\par
Not love . We' re not in love . I' m not saying I love you . Hey , I love you . Whatever . But I' m not saying like I' m in love with you . Roxanne ? Roxaroo ? Get back to work . The city doesn' t pay you to loaf . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Freeze ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Whoa .\par
What are you doing , guys ? It' s me ! It' s the warden . Hey ! Open up ! No , you fools . He' s tricked us . You were right . I' il always be a villain . Well , hello good- looking .\par
Need a lift ? Certainly do , you fantastic fish , you . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Get in the car , you . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I' m free ! Right ? Nice work sending me the watch , Minion . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You got it , boss . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Punch it ! All right , put your hands in the air . Ladies and gentlemen , your Metro Man ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Who' s your man ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Metro Man ! Yeah , Metro City ! Gimme some . Come on . Give it now .\par
Give it to me . Right on . Gimme the good stuff . Hey , Metro City . Hey . Hey . You know , you know , I just want to bring it down a bit . Boys , a little lower . Thank you , fellas . Let' s get real for a moment .\par
That' s right . That' s right . That' s right . Although getting a whole museum is super- cool , is super- cool , you want to know what the greatest honor you' ve given me is ? Do you really want to know ? Really ? I' il tell you . The greatest honor you' ve given me is letting me serve you , the helpless people of Metro City . And at the end of every day , well , I often ask myself \'e2\'80\'a6 who would I be without you ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I love you , Metro Man ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  And I love you , random citizen . I tell you , Minion .\par
There' s no place like evil lair . I' ve kept it cold and damp just for you , sir . How do I look , Minion ? Do I look bad ? Disgustingly horrifying , sir . You always know what to say . Oh , the brain- bots certainly missed you , sir . Did you miss your daddy ? Who' s a menacing little cyborg ? You are .\par
Yes , you are . No biting . No , no , no , no , no , no . You want the wrench ? Go get the wrench . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , look at that . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Now , back to laughing . She' s awake . Quick , to work . Miss Ritchi , we meet again . Would it kill you to wash the bag ? You can scream all you wish , Miss Ritchi .\par
I' m afraid no one can hear you . Wh \'e2\'80\'a6 Why isn' t she screaming ? Miss Ritchi , if you don' t mind ? Like this \'e2\'80\'a6 But that' s , that' s a poor lady scream . He' s a little better . Is there some kind of nerdy super- villain Web site where you get Tesla coils and blinky dials ? Actually , most of it comes from an outlet store in \'e2\'80\'a6 Don' t answer that . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Romania . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Don' t ! Stop !\par
She' s using her nosy reporter skills on your weak- willed mind to find out all our secrets . Such tricks won' t work on me \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Please talk slower . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Temptress . What secrets ? You' re so predictable . Predictable ? Predictable ? Oh , you call this predictable ? Your alligators . Yes . Yeah , I was thinking about it on the way over .\par
What' s this ? Boom ! In your face . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Clich\'c3\'a9 . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No ! Look , watch . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Juvenile . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Shock and awe . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Tacky . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , it' s so scary ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Seen it . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What' s this one do ? Garish . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  OK , the spider' s new . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Spider ? Yes . The \'e2\'80\'a6 The spee- ider . Even the smallest bite from Arachnis deathicus will instantly paralyze \'e2\'80\'a6 Get it off !\par
It bit me ! Give it up , Megamind . Your plans never work . Let' s stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights , shall we ? It is with great pleasure that I present to Metro Man his new museum . If you please . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Metro Man ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Hey ! My kid can' t see . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Megamind ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , bravo , Metro Man . Yes , I can play along too .\par
Boo ! Should' ve known you' d try to crash the party . Oh , I intend to do more than crash it . This is a day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget . It' s pronounced Metro City ! Potato- tomato , potato- tomato . We all know how this ends : with you behind bars . I' m shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots . You will leave Metrocity , or this will be the last you ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi . Roxanne !\par
Don' t panic , Roxie . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I' m on my way . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yeah , I' m not panicking . In order to stop me , you need to find me first , Metro Man . We' re at the abandoned observatory . No , we' re not ! Don' t listen to her . She' s crazy . Metro Man approaching , sir . Hold on a second . Oh , good heavens ! You didn' t think you were in the real observatory , did you ?\par
Ready the death ray , Minion . Death ray , readying . Over here , old friend . In case you haven' t noticed , you' ve fallen right into my trap . You can' t trap justice . It' s an idea , a belief . Even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time . Justice is a non- corrosive metal . But metals can be melted by the heat of revange . It' s \'e2\'80\'9c revenge , \'e2\'80\'9d and it' s best served cold .\par
But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil . Well , I think your warranty is about to expire . Maybe I got an extended warranty . Warranties are invalid if you don' t use the product for its intended purpose . Oh , girls , girls , you' re both pretty . Can I go home now ? Of course . That is , if Metro Man can withstand the full , concentrated power of the sun ! Fire ! Minion .\par
Fire ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  It' s still warming up , sir . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Come again ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Warming up , sir . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Warming up ? The sun is warming up ? One second more and \'e2\'80\'a6 just tippy- tappy tippy- tap- tap , tip- top more , and we are ready in just \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Honestly ! On my way , Roxie . I told you to have things ready . I told you countless times . Why do you always blame me ? My spider bite is acting up . Your plan is failing . Just admit it .\par
Yeah , good luck with that one . Whose side are you on ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  The losing side . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Thank you . Could someone stamp my Frequent Kidnapping Card ? You of all people know we discontinued that promotion . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Ciao- ciao , all ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Same time next week ? Crab nuggets ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What did he just say ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'9c Crab nuggets \'e2\'80\'9d ? Ten seconds to full power . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Good lord , I' m trapped . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Ten \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What kind of trickery is this ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'a6 nine \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You mad genius . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'a6 eight \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Your dark gift has finally paid off . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'a6 seven \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  It \'e2\'80\'a6 It has ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'a6 six \'e2\'80\'a6 This dome is obviously lined with copper . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yeah ? So ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Sir \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Copper drains my powers . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'a6 two \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Your weakness is copper ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'a6 one . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' re kidding , right ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Full power . I don' t think even he could survive that . Well , let' s not get our hopes up just yet . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Look ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Metro Man !\par
Metro Man . Metro Man ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You \'e2\'80\'a6 You did it , sir . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I did it ? He did it . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I did it ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  He did it . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You did it , sir . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I did it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You did it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I did it ! Metrocity is mine ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You did it , sir ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I did it ! Yeah , me , me ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes , I did it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Us ! We both did it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Not us ! I ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You , a little more than me but still , come on ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  A lot more than you . When they' re giving out the awards , \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I' m gonna be right there next to you . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What awards ?\par
Hit it ! Drop ' em ! First off , what a turnout . How wild is this ? All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe . Are there any questions ? Go on . Yes ! You in the back . I' m sure we' d all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city .\par
Good , I' m glad you asked that . Imagine the most horrible , terrifying , evil thing you can possibly think of , and multiply it \'e2\'80\'a6 by six ! In the meantime , I want you to carry on with the dreary , normal things you normal people do . Let' s just have fun with this . Come on . And I will get back to you . Now slam the door really hard . They \'e2\'80\'a6 They can still see you . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Now ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Your elbow' s still in . There he is , Mr Evil Overlord\par
Oh , Minion , did you think this day would ever come ? No way . Not at all , sir . Never . Never in a million \'e2\'80\'a6 I mean \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes , I did . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Look at the intricate mouldings . I' m looking . And what' s this ? It' s like one of the giant monitors in the lair . But it seems to only carry one station . Oh , that , sir , is called a window . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Window ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  All the kids are looking through them .\par
I' ve never had a view before . Metrocity , Minion , it' s all mine . If my parents could see me now . Sir , I' m sure they' re smiling down from evil heaven . And now that Mr Goody Two- Shoes is out of the way , I can have everything I want , and there' s no one to stop me ! I know . I know . Always thirsty , never satisfied . I understand you , little well- dressed bird .\par
Purposeless , emptiness . It' s a vacuum , isn' t it ? It' s \'e2\'80\'a6 What' s your vacuum like ? Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Not now , Minion . I' m in a heated , existential discussion with this dead- eyed , plastic desk toy . Is \'e2\'80\'a6 Is something wrong , sir ? Just think about it . We have it all . Yet , we have nothing .\par
It' s just too easy now . I' m sorry , you' ve lost me , sir . I mean , we did it , right ? Well , you did it , sir . Yes , you' ve made that perfectly clear . Then why do I feel so \'e2\'80\'a6 mel- on- choly . \'e2\'80\'9c Mel- on- choly \'e2\'80\'9d ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Unhappy . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Well \'e2\'80\'a6 What if tomorrow , we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi . That always seems to lift your spirits . Good idea , Minion . But without him , what' s the point ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'9c Him , \'e2\'80\'9d sir ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Nothing .\par
We' il just \'e2\'80\'a6 that' s something to consider \'e2\'80\'a6 and \'e2\'80\'a6 Well , I think I' il just power down for a while then . He was always there for us . Dependable . Perhaps we took him for granted . You know , maybe , we never really know how good we have it until it' s gone . We miss you , Metro Man . I miss you . And I have just one question for Megamind : Are you happy now ? This is Roxanne Ritchi , reporting from a city without a hero .\par
Coming up next , are you ready to be a slave army ? And \'e2\'80\'a6 wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas , ' cause we' re done . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  OK . See you tomorrow , Hal . Wait . Roxie , I' m having a party at my house . It' s gonna be , like , off the hook , or whatever . You should come over . I got a deejay , rented a bouncy house , made a gallon of dip . It' s gonna be sick .\par
I \'e2\'80\'a6 I don' t know , Hal . I don' t really feel like being around a bunch of people . No , no , no , that' s the best part . It' il just be like you and me . That \'e2\'80\'a6 that' s certainly very tempting , but \'e2\'80\'a6 I did hire a wedding photographer . That' s just in case we were like , something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it . Like , maybe we should have this for , like , ever . Like a memory , you know ? I' m gonna pass .\par
I have some work here that I need to do , anyway . Cool . So Thursday ? Soft Thursday ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Good night , Hal . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  That' s a soft yes on Thursday . What' s wrong with me ? Rented a bouncy house ? Chicks don' t like bouncy houses . They like clowns . Stupid van ! You broke my finger !\par
I' ve made a horrible mistake . I didn' t mean to destroy you . I mean , I meant to destroy you , but I didn' t think it would really work . What are we supposed to do ? Without you , evil is running rampant through the streets . I' m so tired of running rampant through the streets . What' s the point of being bad when there' s no good to try and stop you ? Someone has to stop Megamind . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Hey , we' re closing soon . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You scared me . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Barry , right ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Bernard . Bernard . I was just \'e2\'80\'a6 Well , I was talking to myself .\par
You probably think I' m a little bit nuts . I' m not allowed to insult guests directly . Thank you . Just \'e2\'80\'a6 Bernard , I' il just be another minute . OK . Thanks . I had so many evil plans in the works . The illiteracy beam . Typhoon cheese . Robo- sheep .\par
Battles we will now never have . You know , I never had the chance to say goodbye . So it' s good that we have this time now . You know , before I destroy the place . Nothing personal , it just brings back too many painful memories . Hello ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Hello ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Roxanne . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  That' s a pretty tasteless costume . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Costume ? Megamind' s head is not that grossly exaggerated . And you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun . Hello ?\par
Is someone there ? Who' s there ? It' s just you , Bernard . Yes . It' s just me . Bernard . Well , thank you for letting me stay . Look , I wouldn' t stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds if I were you . We' re having the walls and ceiling removed . Wow , that sounds like quite the renovation .\par
I guess I' il catch a ride down with you then . I kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last- minute escapes . He was really good at those . Oh , if only the world had a reset button . I' ve looked into the reset button . The science is impossible . Oh , Bernard \'e2\'80\'a6 I didn' t know you had \'e2\'80\'a6 feelings . Are you OK ? Metro Man' s gone .\par
And now there' s no one left to challenge Megamind . Oh , come on , Bernard . As long as there' s evil , good will rise up against it . Oh , I wish . I believe someone is gonna stand up to Megamind . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You really think so ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yeah . I mean , it' s like they say , \'e2\'80\'9c Heroes aren' t born , they' re made . \'e2\'80\'9d Heroes can be made . That' s it ! All you need are the right ingredients . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yeah . Bravery . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Strength . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Of course . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Determination . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Imperative !\par
And a smidgen of DNA . Oh , with that , anyone can be a hero ! Yeah ! I think we should run ! Bye ! Time to put the past behind us . Only the future \'e2\'80\'a6 I' m too close ! I' m genuinely scared right now . I hope no one' s seeing this !\par
Create a hero ? Wait , wait , what ? Why would you do that ? So I have someone to fight . Minion , I' m a villain without a hero . A yin with no Yang . A bullfighter with no bull to fight . In other words , I have no purpose . Now , ask me how I' m going to do it . Go on !\par
Ask ! How are you gonna do it ? I' m going to give someone \'e2\'80\'a6 I don' t know who yet \'e2\'80\'a6 Metro Man' s powers . I' m going to train that someone to become Metrocity' s new hero . Over here ! Follow ! And then finally , I' m going to fight that hero in an epic battle of good and evil . Which will put everything back the way it was \'e2\'80\'a6 when the world was perfect and rosy . Behold , Minion , Metro Man' s cape .\par
Look closely . Tell me what you see . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Dandruff ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes . It' s his DNA . From this , we' il extract the source of Metro Man' s awesome power . Sir , I think this is a bad idea . Yes ! This is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of man . But I' m saying this is a kind of bad that \'e2\'80\'a6 OK , you might think is good in your bad perception , but from a good perception it \'e2\'80\'a6 it' s just plain bad . Oh , you don' t know what' s good for bad .\par
Now , we have just one shot at this . We must find a suitable subject , someone of noble heart and mind . Who puts the welfare of others above their own . What on Earth is that ? It seems to be emanating from there , sir . Ollo . It' s \'e2\'80\'9c Hello . \'e2\'80\'9d Hello ? Like that ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Bernard , it' s Roxanne . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  It' s Roxanne . I just wanted to thank you for inspiring me the other day . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , you inspired me too . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Great !\par
It' s time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can' t push us around . Oh , really ? She' s so cute . I' m already hot on his trail . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  And what gives you that idea ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Sir ? I just found his secret hideout . How did she find my hideout \'e2\'81\'88 How did you find his hideout ? This is the only building in Metro City with a fake observatory on the roof . There' s no way she' il find the secret entrance . There' s a doormat here that says \'e2\'80\'9c Secrit Entrance \'e2\'80\'9d !\par
\'e2\'80\ldblquote  Minion ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I kept forgetting where it was . She' il discover all our secrets ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , no ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You dim- witted creation of science ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What ? Oh , no , not you , Roxanne . No , I was just yelling at my \'e2\'80\'a6 mother' s urn . Don' t do anything . I' il be right there . Roxanne ? Oh no , not again ! Roxanne ? I' m glad you' re here .\par
Wait , how did you get here so fast ? Well , I \'e2\'80\'a6 I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called . In a suit ? It' s called \'e2\'80\'a6 formal speed walking , but that' s not important . I better take the lead . This way looks exciting . No , it says \'e2\'80\'9c Exit . \'e2\'80\'9d Which is the abbreviation for \'e2\'80\'9c exciting , \'e2\'80\'9d right ? This is the mother lode ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Wow . Just look at this thing . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Wow .\par
You know , I really could use your help in deciphering all this . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Really ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' re an expert \'e2\'80\'a6 on all things Megamind , right ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes . Right . Together , we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Are you in ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , what fun ! That' s what I want to hear . Minion , Code : Send In The Brain- bots . You know , the whole point of a code is \'e2\'80\'a6 Oh , Code : Just Do It , Minion . Intruder ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  It' s me , you fools ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Bernard !\par
It' s Daddy ! Megamind . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What have you done with Bernard ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , Bernard ? Oh , yes . I' m doing horrible things to that man . I don' t want to get into it , but lasers , spikes . No , please ! No ! Not the lasers and the spikes ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You know the drill . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , no ! Not the drill ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Let him go or \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Or what ? Or I' m gonna find out what this weird- looking gun does .\par
No , don' t shoot ! Don' t shoot that gun ! I' il just go get him . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Unhand me , you fiend ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Never ! His strength' s too much ! Oh , I work out ! Well , it' s really paying off ! You' re so fit , and strangely charismatic . Are you OK ? I did my best , but he' s too fantastic . Here .\par
Let me carry that heavy gun for you . I got us covered . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Let go . It' s mine ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Bernard , run ! Roxanne ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' re going to break it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Give it to me ! Oh , no ! Roxanne \'e2\'81\'88 Who on Earth is that ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Help ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Roxanne ! Bernard !\par
You were right about that door being exciting . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Intruder ! Intruder ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  This way . Intruder ! What are you doing ? This' il stop them . Here ! Seems a bit extreme , doesn' t it ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Just throw it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Daddy' s sorry . That was really exciting . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yeah . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You were very strong in there . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I know . I' ve never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What' s going on ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Hal , what happened ?\par
I think a bee flew up my nose . I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you , but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me , so I had to beat ' em all up , and I did , and I \'e2\'80\'a6 They were all , like , crying and stuff \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Wow , a brave one , isn' t he ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Who are you ? Oh , thi \'e2\'80\'a6 this is Bernard . He' s my partner . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Partner ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes . Yes . Partner . Well , look , \'e2\'80\'9c partner , \'e2\'80\'9d I' m her partner . She doesn' t know what she' s saying . She' s been through a traumatic experience . I' d better take him home .\par
Thanks again , Bernard . I' il call you tomorrow , partner . Yeah , OK . I' d like that . That was weird for everybody , ' cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me . Sir ? Sir ! Code : Did You Find Out Who It Was ?\par
Code : Get The Car . Code : Right Away , Sir . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Bye- bye ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  See you tomorrow , Hal . I' il leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later . Who is this man we' ve infused with godlike power ? Well , sir , his name' s Hal Stewart . He' s 28 years old . No criminal record .\par
Actually no records at all . Apparently this man hasn' t accomplished anything . Not yet , Minion . Not \'e2\'80\'a6 yet . Could this day get anymore fun- tastic ? So , I will just go ahead and diffuse him since this is clearly a mistake . No , Minion ! There' s something much more powerful at work here . This is no mistake . It' s destiny .\par
Hal Shtewart ! Prepare for your destiny ! Hal ? Hal Shtewart ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Hey ! In the bed ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Am I saying it right ? \'e2\'80\'9c Stewart . \'e2\'80\'9d Is this a robbery ? ' Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me . Oh , look , it' s Hal Stewart . Quick , the spray . All out . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Well , use the Forget- Me Stick . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , right .\par
Just look at him . No , he doesn' t look quite the hero- type to me . Oh , you' re such a pill , Minion . A potter couldn' t ask for finer clay . I smell a hero . I smell something burning . I think it' s working . Places ! Places ! Places !\par
Places ! Do you have your disguise ? What ? Oh , you look fantastic . Rise my glorious creation . Rise , and come to Papa . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What' s going on ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Easy my child . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Who are you ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice , honor , and nobility . I am your father . So you' re like my space dad ? Yeah , I' m like your space dad . And you are what ?\par
I' m your space step- mom . I' ve had some work done recently . Is this some kind of dream ? This is a dream come true . You' ve been blessed with unfathomable power . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What kind of power ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Unfathomable . It' s unf \'e2\'80\'a6 without fathom . We' ve come to guide you on your path to be Metrocity' s new hero and battle the super- genius of Megamind . I know this is a lot to take in . It may take months for you to come to grips . No freaking way !\par
I wasn' t finished . I' m gonna be a hero ! I' m gonna be a hero ! See , Minion , he' s perfect ! And \'e2\'80\'a6 action ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Someone help me ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I' m OK ! Zap ! Zap ! Zap ! The flames of my evil burn bright . Now you say something cool back at me .\par
Look . It doesn' t even hurt . Don' t even feel it . No , no , no , no , no . Stomach down , hands up . Like Metro Man . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Whoa ! Wait ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Watch out . He' s hopeless . Hopeless ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Maybe we should change tactics . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You think so ? Oh , you know how boys are .\par
They love video games . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I could throw a few parts together . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Can' t wait . Smiley face . Can' t wait for what , sir ? That was such a funny story . And brilliantly told , by the way . OK , now you tell one . Bernard , I never knew you were so funny . And I never heard you laugh before . Yeah , it' s been a while . Feels pretty good .\par
And action . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You don' t get out much , do you ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , what fun ! I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid . It was one of my favorite things to do . Now look at it . It' s a dump . Why are we cleaning up the city , sir ? Well , we don' t want to battle our new hero in a dump now , do we ? They' re all back . But how ?\par
Why ? Maybe Megamind isn' t so bad after all . That' s it . Be free , my beautiful dove ! Metro Man and I were never a couple . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  But I thought you two were \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I know . Everybody did . It' s just \'e2\'80\'a6 Well , he was never really my type . Really ? OK , now you tell me something . Something you' ve never told anyone .\par
Well , in sh \'e2\'80\'a6 school \'e2\'80\'a6 none of the other kids really liked me . I was always the last one picked for everything . It' s too bad that we didn' t go to the same school . Hal , I think you' re ready for this . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Do I have a son ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No . You make me laugh . It stretches . It' s for you . Hey , what' s the T stand for ? Titan . \'e2\'80\'9c Titan \'e2\'80\'9d ?\par
It was the only name I could trademark . Do you have someone special in your life , Hal ? No , not yet . But \'e2\'80\'a6 there' s this really , really good- looking one I' ve got my eye on currently . That' s very good . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Romance is very inspiring . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  That' s what I hear . All you have to do is save her and she' il be yours . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Who wants churros ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I do ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I do , yeah . Thanks , Space Step- mom . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Churros all the way around . On the count of three , unsheathe your churro . One , two , three !\par
To Titan ! Tomorrow , you will fight Megamind , and the city will know your name . the city' s parks restored to their original glory , the streets the safest they' ve been , the banks reopened . Has something happened to Megamind ? Has someone tamed this monster ? This is Roxanne Ritchi , cautiously optimistic , and pleasantly confused . Well , you seem in a very good mood tonight , sir . Oh , yes . How long is this going to take , Minion ? Just a few alterations , sir , and I will be done with your most terrifying cape yet !\par
I' m calling it \'e2\'80\'a6 the Black Mamba \'e2\'80\'a6 Black Mamba . Perfect . Gosh , I am running late . I have to go . What ? Where \'e2\'80\'a6 Where are you going , sir ? We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning . We haven' t even tested your big battle suit yet . You attend to the details , Minion .\par
I have to \'e2\'80\'a6 run a quick errand . You don' t run errands . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What' s going on here ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What ? Oh , wait a minute . Are you wearing Jean Paul Gaultier' s Pour Homme ? It' s just my natural musk . Now , where are the car keys ? This is about Ms Ritchi , isn' t it ? You' re going on a date with her . No , my main man . Get out of town .\par
Oh , this is bad . This is bad . You' ve fallen in love with her . You are forgetting your place , Minion . Now give me the keys . What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are ? She will never find out . That' s the point of lying . Honestly , if I didn' t know any better , I' d think this was your first day of being evil .\par
No ! This has gone far enough ! Oh , that was really grown- up ! Sir , sir , please . It' s for your own good . Oh , what do you know ? I may not know much , but I do know this : The bad guy doesn' t get the girl . Maybe I don' t want to be the bad guy anymore . You heard me !\par
Who are you ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Now , give me the keys ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No ! My sole purpose in life is to look after you . Well , I don' t need you to look after me . What are you s \'e2\'80\'a6 What are you saying ? You don' t need me ? Let me make it clear . Code : I Don' t Need You . You know what ? You know what ?\par
Code : I' il Just Pack My Thing And Go ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Code : Fine ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Code : Fine Back ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Well , good luck on your date ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I will ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  That doesn' t even make any sense ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I know ! I know I am so close . I can feel it . OK , OK . I just have to take a step back . Wait a minute .\par
\'e2\'80\'9c Titan . \'e2\'80\'9d \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What' s a Titan ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  My super- ears are burning . I usually just hear criminals . You haven' t been naughty , have you ? I' m totally messing with you . I' m totally messing with you . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  The name' s Titan . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Titan . Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome . What' s your name ? Just kidding . I know everything about you . And I \'e2\'80\'a6 And I brought some flowers .\par
Didn' t know what you liked , so I just grabbed , you know , all of them . OK . You don' t like flowers ? OK , forget the flowers . What do you want ? Thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town . Get to know each other first . This must be very thrilling for you . What do you think you' re doing \'e2\'81\'88 Oh , am I moving too fast ?\par
You' re probably right . I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic . Saved ya . You are lucky to have such a great hero here . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Don' t you ever \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , no ! Somebody do something ! Oh , right , right , duh . I gotcha . That was a close one . You almost died , but I saved you . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Building ! Gotcha !\par
I' m sorry . What were you saying ? I couldn' t hear you over the sound of me saving your life . Put me down ! Right now ! OK , all right . All right , hold on . Are you crazy ? I suppose I' m a , I' m a little crazy , about you . Who are you , really ?\par
Oh , right . Well , prepare to have your mind blown , little lady . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Ta- da . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Hal ? Yeah . Isn' t this great ? Now there' s nothing keeping us apart . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No . It' s not great . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Wow . Our first fight . This is so us . We' re like an old married couple .\par
Look , there is no \'e2\'80\'9c us , \'e2\'80\'9d OK ? There will never be an \'e2\'80\'9c us . \'e2\'80\'9d But \'e2\'80\'a6 I have powers . I have a cape . I' m the good guy . You are a good guy , Hal , but you don' t understand . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  We need to find out why \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No , no . This \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Hal , just take a deep breath \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  This isn' t right ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  \'e2\'80\'a6 and listen to me for a moment . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' re supposed to be with me ! I' m trying to warn you , Hal . It' s Titan ! It' s Titan , not Hal !\par
\'e2\'80\ldblquote  Bernard . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Roxanne . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Sorry I' m late . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Wow , your hair looks exciting . Not the only exciting development of the night . Megamind' s created a new hero , and I know why . It all makes sense now . He missed getting his butt kicked , so he created a new hero to kick it for him . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yeah . But why would he pick Hal ? Hal is the worst possible person you could pick . Wow . That' s a lot to take in . It boggles my mind .\par
I am extremely boggled . You know , I' m sure we' il get to the bottom of who' s kicking whose butt . But in the meantime , let' s enjoy each other' s company . I' m sorry , Bernard , of course , you' re right . You know , I could use a breather . To Bernard , for being the only normal thing in my crazy , upside- down world . To \'e2\'80\'a6 being normal . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Roxanne ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes ? Say I wasn' t so normal . Let' s say I was bald and had the complexion of , of a popular primary color , as a random , nonspecific example .\par
\'e2\'80\ldblquote  Would you still enjoy my company ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Of course ! You don' t judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside . That' s a relief to hear . You judge them based on their actions . Well , that seems kind of petty , don' t you think ? What ? What ? Don' t look at me ! Just a technical glitch ! Don' t look yet !\par
Well , never mind that . Where were we ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Now , now , hold on . You ! I can explain ! What about everything you just said ? About judging a book by its cover ? Well , let' s take a look at the contents then , shall we ? You destroyed Metro Man , you took over the city , and then , you actually got me to care about you ! Why are you so evil ?\par
Tricking me ? What could you possibly hope to gain ? Wait a minute . I don' t believe this . Do you really think that I would ever be with you ? No . OK , Minion ! You were right ! I was \'e2\'80\'a6 less right ! We should stick to what we' re good at \'e2\'80\'a6 being bad .\par
Minion ? You there ! Yeah , you . Bring out the Black Mamba . OK , Titan . It' s time to go down in style . I hear there' s a new hero who dares challenge my evil . Where is the one they call Titan ? Challenge me if you dare ! Oh no .\par
We' re gonna crash ! This is embarrassing . Of all the inconsiderate , bone- headed \'e2\'80\'a6 irresponsible , rude \'e2\'80\'a6 Unprofessional , that' s what this is ! Would Metro Man have kept me waiting ? Of course not ! He was a pro ! Hey , Megamind ! You' re actually the guy I want to see . Also , there' s a door here .\par
Do you have any idea how long I waited for you ? No , no , no , I totally understand what you' re saying . Could you just , just shut up for one second . I' m trying to beat this level . Were you even planning on showing up ? What' s this ? Where did you get all this stuff ? It doesn' t belong to me . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You stole it ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Pretty cool , right ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No , no , no , no ! You' re a hero ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Being a hero is for losers ! It' s work , work , work , 24/ 7 , and for what ?\par
I only took the gig to get the girl , and it turns out Roxanne doesn' t want anything to do with me . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Roxanne Ritchi ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yeah ! Roxanne Ritchi ! I saw her having dinner and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb ! Who needs all that noise ? That' s why I think we should team up . You \'e2\'80\'a6 Wait \'e2\'80\'a6 What ? With my power , and your big- headedness , we could rule the city ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You want to team up ? I even drew up some new costume designs , see ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Costume designs ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' d be the brains , so you' d get a little brain , wearing glasses on your costume , or something . And since I' m the cool one , I' d have , like , two tanks swordfighting \'e2\'80\'a6 I can' t believe you .\par
All your gifts , all your powers , and you \'e2\'80\'a6 you squander them for your own personal gain . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No ! I' m the villain ! I do something bad , and you come and get me ! That' s why I created you . Yeah , right . You' re nuts . Space Dad told me \'e2\'80\'a6 Look , I' m your space dad ! You should be more like Metro Man . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You tricked me ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Oh , don' t like that ?\par
Well , there' s more . I' m also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  And we were smooching up a storm ! When I get my hands on you , I' m gonna \'e2\'80\'a6 Yes ! Yes , I know ! Bring me to justice . Oh God , how I' ve missed this . And the hero strikes the first blow . But evil returns with a backhand ! Yes !\par
Come out , you little freak ! I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement ! You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book ! You little blue twerp ! En garde ! Oh , now that' s the spirit ! Parry ! Thrust ! Parry again ! Now it' s time for some witty back and forth banter !\par
You go first ! Look , I' m not sure where to go with that ! This one' s for stealing my girlfriend ! This one' s for Space Dad making a fool out of me ! And , Megamind , this one' s for Space Step- mom ! Well done . I thought that battle went really , really well . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I mean , I have a few notes . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Notes ? But they can wait . You can take me to jail now . Oh , no , no , no .\par
I was thinking more like the morgue . You' re dead ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . This isn' t how you play the game . Game over . Brain- bots ! I' m calling time out ! Time out ? Time out ! Time out !\par
Brain- bots , initiate the fail- safe . Guess what , Buster Brown ? It' s made from copper . You' re powerless against it . It' s the very same metal used to defeat \'e2\'80\'a6 Metro Man ? You should stop comparing me to Metro Man ! You can run , Megamind , but you can' t hide ! We' re saved ! We' re saved ! What' s your name , new hero ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  It' s Titan . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Thank you !\par
Thank you ! Titan has freed us ! Oh , I wouldn' t say \'e2\'80\'9c free . \'e2\'80\'9d More like under new management . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What do you want ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Titan' s turned evil . Congratulations . Another one of your genius plans has backfired on you . And why did my doorman let you up ? Carlos . Please , Roxanne , no . No .\par
I need your help . Why do you need my help ? Because you' re the smartest person I know . But you can' t hide here . The copper should have worked . Why didn' t the copper work ? The copper worked perfectly well last time . Copper ? You' re not making any sense . Look , if we don' t find Titan' s weakness , he' il destroy the whole city .\par
\'e2\'80\ldblquote  OK , how can I help ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  We need to find answers . You knew Metro Man best . Did he have a hideout ? A cave ? A solitary fortress of some kind ? Anything that would give us clues . Well \'e2\'80\'a6 there is one place I know . You gave him these powers . Can' t you just take them away ? I can' t .\par
I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car . The night you dumped me . Alone . In the rain . Did you ever look back ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  My giant blue head ! I guess we' re here . So , this is where he hid it . After all these years . My old shool- house . You know , I think there' s an apology in order for the other night .\par
OK , that would be nice , but make it quick . We have much more pressing matters to deal with . Wow . I can' t believe he kept all this stuff . I remember when he wore that . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Shouldn' t we try to stay focused here ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Yes , of course . Right . Focused . Come over and look at this . What is it ? What did you find ?\par
Look . This glass has ice cubes in it . Yes , that' s what happens when water gets cold . No , what I' m saying is , don' t you think it' s a little odd that the ice hasn' t melted yet ? One of life' s great mysteries . Hey . We now have confirmed reports . Titan , first thought to be this city' s new hero , has turned evil . The city has never seen this level of destruction . If only Metro Man were still alive . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' re alive ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' re alive . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I' m alive . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  But I , we \'e2\'80\'a6\par
We saw your skeleton ! You were dead ! Are you a ghost ? There had better be an amazing explanation for this . Speak , apparition . OK . OK , OK , OK . You both deserve the truth . It all started back at the observatory . Roxanne was kidnapped .\par
I was gonna stop you . My head wasn' t in the game that day . We were kind of going through the motions . So \'e2\'80\'a6 using my super- speed , I decided to go clear my head . Fire ! Then I realized , we had done this same silly charade our entire lives . I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling , but I just felt stuck . I began to realize , despite all my powers , each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn' t : a choice . Ever since I can remember , I' ve always had to be what the city wanted me to be .\par
But what about what I wanted to do ? Then it suddenly hit me . I do have a choice . I can be whatever I want to be . No one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig . You can' t just quit , either . That' s when I got the brilliant idea \'e2\'80\'a6 to fake my death . Copper drains my powers . Your weakness is copper ? Once your death ray hit , I' d never felt so alive .\par
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school . Metro Man was finally dead . And Music Man was born ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Music Man ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  That way I could keep my logo . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  ' Cause of wha \'e2\'80\'a6 ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Come again ? I was finally free to get in touch with my true power \'e2\'80\'a6 weaving lyrical magic . Check this out . I have eyes that can see Right through lead \'e2\'80\'a6 \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You' re horrible ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Granted , you have talent . But there' s a madman out there destroying our \'e2\'80\'a6 your city . How could you do this \'e2\'81\'88 The people of this city relied on you , and you deserted them !\par
You left us in the hands of him ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No offense . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  No , I' m with you . Look , we need your help . I' m sorry . I really am . I' m done . You know , little buddy , there' s a yin for every Yang . If there' s bad , good will rise up against it . It' s taken me a long time to find my calling . Now it' s about time you find yours . Hey , who needs him ?\par
We can beat Titan ourselves . I say we go back to the evil lair , grab some ray guns , hold him sideways , and just go all gangsta on him . We can' t . So that' s it ? You' re just giving up ? I' m the bad guy . I don' t save the day , I don' t fly off into the sunset , and I don' t get the girl . I' m going home . Unless someone comes to our aid soon , all may be lost . Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus .\par
Remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice . Authorities have issued a warning to stay out of the downtown area at all costs . Hal ! Hal ! Let me guess . After seeing how awesome I am , you' ve finally come to your senses ? Well , I' m over you . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I' ve come to stop you , Hal . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You ? Oh , wow . OK , what are you gonna do , report me to death ? I was going to try reasoning with you .\par
You and I , we worked together for a long time . I know you . You don' t know me . You never took the time to know me . This is the first time we' ve hung out socially , and it' s when I' m about to destroy the city ! I want to talk to the real Hal . I want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman , and eating dip , and being a nerd , and being not as scary as the Tighten Hal . Too late ! Megamind ! You and I have some unfinished business .\par
I' il be waiting at Metro Tower . Oh , and just so you don' t get cold feet \'e2\'80\'a6 Roxanne . Come on , Roxie , call for your hero to come rescue you . Megamind , I don' t even know if you' re listening , but if you are , you can' t give up . The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight , even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning . It was your best quality . You need to be that guy right now . The city needs you . I need you .\par
Roxanne . You have one hour . Don' t keep me waiting . Warden ! Warden ! Listen to me ! You have to let me go ! Tighten has to be stopped ! Sorry , Megamind . You still have 88 life sentences to go .\par
Plenty of time to reflect on what you' ve done . Did you want to hear me say it ? I' il say it . Here it is , from the blackest part of my heart . I am sorry ! Not buying it . I don' t blame you . I' ve terrorized this city countless times . Created a hero who' s turned out to be a villain . I lied to Roxanne , and \'e2\'80\'a6 my best friend Minion , I treated like dirt .\par
Please don' t make this city \'e2\'80\'a6 don' t make Roxanne pay for my wrongdoings . Apology accepted . Oh , Minion , you fantastic fish , you . What are we waiting for ? We' d better get going . You got me . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Good luck , fellas ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  We' re gonna die ! Wait , what ? Hey , Metro losers . This is Metro Tower .\par
They say it' s supposed to be a symbol of our city' s strength . But for me , it' s a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart . And I hate reminders ! Help ! Please don' t do this . I know there' s still good in you , Hal . You' re so naive , Roxie . You see the good in everybody , even when it' s not there . You' re living a fantasy . There is no Easter Bunny , there is no Tooth Fairy , and there is no Queen of England .\par
This is the real world , and you need to wake up ! You dare challenge Megamind ? This town isn' t big enough for two super- villains ! Oh , you' re a villain all right ! Just not a super one ! Yeah ? What' s the difference ? Presentation ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  I knew you' d come back . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Well , that made one of us . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  What' s the plan ? \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Well , it mostly involves not dying .\par
I like that plan . Building ! Go faster ! Make this thing go faster ! I can' t control it ! No . Well , that was easy . Looks like there' s only one loose end now . Please , let' s have a little respect for public transportation . You came back !\par
You were right , Roxanne . I never should have left . I \'e2\'80\'a6 I thought you were dead . My death was \'e2\'80\'a6 greatly exaggerated . So , you' re the punk I' ve heard about . I' m sorry . I did the best I could . I' m so proud of you . Minion ? Surprise !\par
He' s the real hero . Megamind . Going somewhere ? Besides jail ? No , not in the face , man . Please . If you know what' s good for you , Tighten , you' il stay out of Metrocity ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You got it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  For good ! Pretty sneaky , sis . But there' s only one person I know who calls this town \'e2\'80\'9c Metrocity . \'e2\'80\'9d You .\par
Bet you think it' s really funny ? Let' s all laugh at the really cool guy ? Well , you' re not gonna be laughing for long . The invisible car . Hey ! Remember that night that I dumped you ? You' re bringing this up now ? Well , I did look back ! You did ? You did ?\par
Yes ! And you should look back right now ! Oh , I get it ! This is the last time you make a fool out of me ! I made you a hero . You did the fool thing all by yourself . You' re so pathetic . No matter what side you' re on , you' re always the loser . There' s a benefit to losing . You get to learn from your mistakes .\par
Oh , you' ve got to be kidding me ! Minion , if I live , I will kill you . Enjoy your flight ! Megamind ! So this is how it ends . Normally , I' d chalk this up to my last glorious failure . But not today . What can I say ? Old habits die hard . Say bye- bye , Roxie .\par
Ollo . The thing about bad guys , they always lose ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You did it . You won . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Well \'e2\'80\'a6 I finally had a reason to win . You . Minion ! Can' t see . It' s cold and \'e2\'80\'a6 warm , and dark and light . It' s me , Minion .\par
I' m right here . We' ve had a lot of adventures together , you and I. We have , Minion . I mean \'e2\'80\'a6 most of them ended in horrible failure , but we won today . Didn' t we , sir ? Yes , Minion , we did it . Thanks to you . Code : We' re The Good Guys Now . Code :\par
I Guess We Are . Oh , oh , oh , I' m going ! I think this , this is it ! I' m going \'e2\'80\'a6 going far \'e2\'80\'a6 What a drama queen . You know , I' m feeling much better now . I guess I just needed a swim . He had you , didn' t he ? Classic Minion . Don' t give me that face .\par
He reels you in with that little face . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Look at that face . \'e2\'80\ldblquote  We did it ! We did it ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  Fist pump ! \'e2\'80\ldblquote  You did it ! We won , we won , we won ! Get back , you savages ! Sorry ! Sorry . He' s just not used to positive feedback . Funny , I guess destiny is not the path given to us \'e2\'80\'a6 but the path we choose for ourselves . All right , put your hands in the air . Now hand over your wallets .\par
I' m just kidding ! Just kidding ! I have to admit , being good has its perks . You know , you look pretty good in white . Megamind , if you plea \'e2\'80\'a6 My kid can' t see . Sorry , my friend . Way to go , little buddy . I knew he had it in him . Ladies and gentlemen ,\par
Megamind , defender of Metro City ! You know , I like the sound of that . Hit it ! I' m bad ! I' m bad ! Sir , you really need to empty your pockets more often . This has been the worst day of my entire life . No worries . Here' s my day , so far . Went to jail , lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked .\par
Pretty good . Still , things could be a lot worse . Oh , that' s right , I' m falling to my death . Guess they can' t . How did it all come to this , you ask ? My end starts at the beginning . The very beginning . Yes , that' s me . I had a fairly standard childhood . I came from what you might call , a broken home .\par
Literally , broken . I was eight days old and still living with my parents . How sad is that ? Clearly it was time to move on . Here is your , Minion , he will take care of you . And here is your binkie . You are destined for ... I didn' t quite hear that last part . But it sounded important . Destined for , what ?\par
I set out to find my destiny . Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea . That was the day I met , Mr. Goody- two- shoes . And our glorious rivalry , was born ! Could this be what I was destined for ? A dream life filled with luxury ? Apparently not . Even fate picks its favorites . No big deal . A much different fate awaited me .\par
A baby . How thoughtful . Oh yes , yes . I saw it and thought of you . Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home . Can we keep it ? A place that taught me the differences between right ... ... and wrong . Mr. Goody- Two- Shoes on the other hand , had life handed to him on a silver platter . Our baby can fly . Yes , yes .\par
Nothing but the best for you , Darling . The power of flight , invulnerability , and great hair . But I had something far , far greater , My amazing intellect . A knack for building objects of mayhem . After a few years , and with some time off for good behavior . I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning . At a strange place called shh- ool . It was there that I once again ran into Mr. Goody- Two- Shoes . He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies .\par
He bought their affections with showmanship , and extravagant gifts of deliciousness . So I too would make this ' popped- corn ' and win over those mindless dregs . Lights out ! That' s when I learned a very hard lesson . Good receives all the praise and adulation . While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner . So a fitting end wasn' t really an option . While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider . I learned how to dehydrate animate objects . and rehydrate them at will . Some day\'e2\'80\'99 s it felt like it was just me and Minion , against the world .\par
No matter how hard I tried . I was always the odd man out . The last one picked . The screw- up , the black sheep . The bad boy . Was this my destiny ? Wait ! Maybe it was . Being bad is the one thing I' m good at . Then it hit me .\par
If I was the bad boy . Then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all . I was destined to be a super villain . And we were destined to be rivals . The die had been cast . And so began an enduring epic , life long career . And I loved it . Our battles quickly got more elaborate . He would win some , I would almost win others . He took the name , Metro Man .\par
Defender of Montrosity . I decided to pick something a little more humble . Megamind . Incredibly handsome criminal genius , and master of all villainy . Read on your own time . Open up . Oh , good morning , Warden . Great news , I' m a changed man . And I' m ready to re- enter society as a solid citizen . You' re a villain , and you' il always be a villain .\par
You' il never change . And you' il never leave . - You' re fun . - You got a present in the mail . Is it a puppy ? From Metro Man . To count every second of your 85 life sentences . That' s funny , never thought Metro Man was the gloating type . Oh but he does have nice taste . I think I' il keep it .\par
Any chance you could give me the time ? I don' t want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum . Oh no , looks like you' re gonna miss it . By several thousand years . Oh , am I ? Happy Metro Man day , Metro City . It' s a beautiful day in beautiful downtown where we' re here to honor a beautiful man . Metro Man . His heart is an ocean that' s inside a bigger ocean . For years he' s been watching us with his super- vision .\par
Saving us with his super strength , and caring for us with his super heart . Now it' s our turn to give something back . This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live , from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum . Wow , okay , the stuff they make you read on the air . That' s unfreaking believable , it' s crazy . I wrote that piece myself , Hal . What I was trying to say was , I can' t believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news . - Nice save , Hal . - What are we , like lets just get a coffee or something .\par
Come on , it' s time to get in the Metro Man day spirit . Well , if I were Metro Man Megamind wouldn' t be kidnapping you all the time . That' s the first thing . That' s sweet of you . And I' d be watching you , like a dingo watches a human baby . - Mmm . - Okay , that sounded , Okay that sounded a little weird . A little bit , yeah . And you' re making a weird face , and that' s making me feel weird . Not love , we' re not in love .\par
I' m not saying I love you . Okay , I love you , whatever . I' m not saying like I' m in love with you . I' m saying ... Roxanne ? Roxaroo ? Get back to work . The city doesn' t pay you to loaf . - Freeze ! - Whoa , what are you doing , guys ? It' s ME !\par
It' s the Warden . Hey , open up . Oh , you fools . He' s tricked us . You were right . I' il always be a villain . Well hello good looking , need a lift ? Certainly do , you fantastic fish you . Get in the car , you . Whoo , I' m free .\par
Thanks for sending me the watch , Minion . You got it , boss . Punch it . All right , put your hands in the air . Ladies and gentlemen , your Metro Man . - Who' s your Man ? - Metro man . Yeah , Metro City ! Give me some , come on give it now . Give it to me .\par
What ? Give it to me ... all right ! Hey , Metro city . Hello , hey . You know , I just want you to bring it down a bit . Boys , a little lower . Thank you fellows . Let' s get real for a moment . That' s right , that' s right ha , ha , that' s right . Although getting a whole museum is super cool .\par
Super cool , you want to know what the greatest honor you' ve given me is ? Do you really want to know ? Really ? I' il tell you . The greatest honor you' ve given me is ... ... letting me serve you . To help these people in Metro city . And at the end of every day . ( Sighs ) Well . I often ask myself . Who would I be , without you ?\par
Man screams : I love you Metro Man ! And I love you , random citizen . I tell you Minion , there' s no place like evil lair . I kept it cold and damp , just for you , sir . How do I look , Minion ? - Do I look bad ? - Disgustingly horrifying , sir . You always know what to say . All the brain- bots certainly missed you , sir .\par
Did you miss your daddy ? Whose the menacing little brains ? You are , yes you are . Uh , uh ! No biting , no , no , no . - No , no , no . You want the wrench ? Go get the wrench . - Oh , look at that . Now , back to work .\par
She' s awake , Quick , to work . - Miss Ritchi , we meet again . - Would it kill you to wash the bag ? You can scream all you wish , Miss Ritchi . I' m afraid no one can hear you . Wha .. why isn' t she screaming ? Miss Ritchi , if you don' t mind . Like this ... AHHHHH ! That' s , that' s a poor ladies scream . - AHHHHH !!!\par
- It' s a little better . Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website , where you get Tesla coils , and blinky dials ? Actually most of it comes from an outlet store in ... Don' t answer that . ( Whispers ) ... Romania . Don' t ! Stop ! She' s using her nosey reporter skills , on your weak willed mind to find out all our secrets . ( Gasps in fear ) Such tricks ... won' t work ... on me .\par
- Please talk slower - Temptress . What secrets ? You' re so predictable . Predictable , predictable ? Oh , you call THlS predictable ? Your Alligators , yes . I was thinking about it on the way over . What' s this ? BOOM ! - In your face .\par
- Clich\'c3\'a9 . No , look , watch . Juvenile . - Shuck it all ! - Tacky - Oh , so sorry . - Seen it . - What' s this one do ? - Garish . Roxanne :\par
Okay , the spiders new . Spider ? Ee , Uh , yes ! The " spee .. ider " . Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus Will instantly paralyze ... OW ! Get it off ! Megamind : Ow ! - Give it up , Megamind .\par
Your plans never work . Let' s stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights , shall we ? OOOWWW ! It is with great pleasure that I present to Metro Man , this new museum . If you please . Uh , hey , my kid can' t see . - Megamind . - Oh , bravo Metro Man . Yes , I can play along too . Booooo .\par
Should have known you' d try to crash the party . Oh , I intend to do more than crash it . This is the day you and Montrosity , shall not soon forget . It' s pronounced Metro City ! Oh , potato , tomato , potato , tomato . We all know how this ends . With you behind bars . Oh , I' m shaking in my custom baby seal- leather boots . You will leave , Montrosity . Megamind :\par
Or this will be the last you ever hear of , Roxanne Ritchi ! - Roxanne ! - Don' t panic Roxie , I' m on my way . - I' m not panicking . In order to stop me , You need to find me first , Metro Man . We' re at the abandoned observatory . - Ah ha . - NO ! No we' re not !\par
Megamind : Don' t listen to her , she' s crazy . Metro Man approaching , sir . - HAH ! Hold on a second . Megamind : Oh , good heavens . You didn' t think you were in the real observatory , did you ? Ready the death ray , Minion . Death ray , readying .\par
Megamind : Over here , old friend . Megamind : In case you haven' t noticed , You' ve fallen right into my trap . You can' t trap justice . It' s an idea , a belief . Even the most heartfelt belief , can be corroded over time . Justice is a noncorrosive metal . But metals can be melted by the heat of ' re- vange ' .\par
It' s ' revenge ' and it' s best served cold . But it can be easily reheated , in the microwave of evil . Well I think your warranty is about to expire . Maybe I got an extended warranty ? Warranties are invalid if you don' t use the product for its intended purpose . Oh , girls , girls , you' re both pretty . Can I go home now ? Of course , that is if Metro Man , can withstand the full concentrated power of the ... SUN ! FlRE ! Minion , fire ...\par
Uh , it' s still warming up , sir . - Come again ? - Warming up , sir . Warming up ? The sun is warming up ? One ... sssecond ... more . aaannnd .... jussst . Minion : Tippy , tappy tippy tap , tap , tip top more . - Honestly . - And we are ready , in just .\par
Oh ! I told you to have things ready . I told you countless times . Why do you always blame me ? My spider bite is acting . Your plan is failing , just admit it . Yeah , good luck with that one . Whose side are you on ? The losing side . - Thank you .\par
- Uh , could someone stamp my frequent kidnapping card ? You of all people , know we discontinued that promotion . - Chow , chow all . - Same time next week ? What did he just say ? Crab nuggets ? Good lord , I' m trapped . What kind of trickery is this ? You mad genius . Your dark gift has finally paid off .\par
It , it has ? This dome is obviously lined with copper . - Yeah , so ? - Minion : Sir ! Metro Man : Copper drains my powers . Your weakness is copper ? You' re kidding , right ? ( coughs ) I don' t think even he could survive that .\par
Well , lets not get our hopes up just yet . - Look ! - Metro Man . ( Gasps ) Metro Man ... Metro Man ! AHHH ! You did it , sir . I did it ? He did it . Megamind :\par
I did it . He did it . - You did it , sir . - I did it ! - You did it . - I did it ! Montrocity is mine ! You did it sir , you did it , sir . Yes you did . Minion :\par
All right people , hit it . ( Minion and Megamind complimenting each other ) Hit it ! * - Ain' t got nothing I' d rather do . * Megamind : First off , what a turnout . How wild is this , huh ? All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe . Megamind : Are there any questions ? Megamind :\par
Come on .. yes ? You in the back . I' m sure we' d all like to know what you plan to do with us . And the city . Good , I' m glad you asked that one . Imagine , the most horrible , terrifying evil thing you could possibly think of . And multiply it by ... SlX ! Megamind : In the mean time I want you to carry on , with the dreary normal things you , Normal people do .\par
Let' s just have fun with this , come on . And I will get back to you . Megamind : Now slam the door , really hard . ( Minion giggles ) Megamind : They can ... they can still see you . Minion : Now ? Yeah , you' re still there . Minion :\par
Oh , Megamind : ( Singing in Miss America melody ) There he is , Mr. Evil Overlord . Ahh , Minion . Did you think this day would ever come ? No way , not at all , sir . Never , never in a million , I mean ... Yes , I did . Look at the intricate moon links . I' m looking , I' m looking . And what' s this ?\par
Looks like one of the giant monitors , in the lair . But it seems to only carry one station . Oh , that sir is called a window . - Window ... - All the kids are looking through them . Oooo , I' ve never had a view before . Montrosity Minion , it' s all mine . If my parents could see me now . Sir , I' m sure they' re smiling down from evil heaven . Well now that Mr. Goody- two- shoes is out of the way .\par
I can have , everything I want ! And there' s no one to stop me . * Looking forward to , but who wouldn' t do , the role I was about ... * Megamind : I know , I know . Always thirsty , never satisfied . Megamind : I understand you , little well dressed bird . Purposeless , emptiness , it' s a vacuum isn' t it . What' s your vacuum like ?\par
Hey , hey , hey ! Not now , Minion . I' m in a heated existential discussion with this dead- eyed plastic desk toy . I ... is something wrong , sir ? Just think about it . We have it all . But we have nothing . It' s just to easy now . I' m sorry , you' ve lost me , sir . - I mean , we did it , right ?\par
- Well , you did it , sir . Yes you' ve made that perfectly clear . - Then why do I feel so , Mel- on- cholly ? - Huh ? Unhappy . Oh , uh well , uh . What if tomorrow , we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi . That always seems to lift your spirits . Good idea , Minion . But without him , what' s the point ?\par
- Minion : Him , sir ? - Nothing . Okay , um , all right well just uh , that\'e2\'80\'99 s uh , something to consider and um , well , I think I' il just power down for a while then . Roxanne : He was always there for us . Roxanne : Dependable . Perhaps we took him for granted . Maybe we never really know how good we have it , until it' s gone .\par
We miss you , Metro Man . I , miss you . Roxanne : And I have just one question for , Megamind . Are you happy now ? This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a city without a hero . Roxanne : Coming up next . Are you ready to be a slave army ? What you need to know .\par
Aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas . - ' Cause we' re done . - Okay , see you tomorrow , Hal . Wait , Roxie . I' m having a party at my house . Coming off the hook , or whatever . You should come over . I got a DJ rented a bouncy house . Made a gallon of dip . It' s gonna be sick .\par
Oh , I don' t know , Hal . I don' t really fell like being around a bunch of people . That' s the best part , it' il be like just you and me . Wow , that uh , that' s certainly very tempting . - But , - I did hire a wedding photographer . That' s just in case , we were like something crazy happened . And you' d want a picture of it . Like maybe we should have this for like ever , Um , I' m gonna pass . I have some work here I need to do .\par
Okay , bye . So Thursday ? Soft , Thursday ? - Goodnight , Hal . - It' s a soft yes , on Thursday . What' s , wrong with me ? Rented a bouncy house ? Chick' s don' t like bouncy houses , they like clown' s . OW ! Hal :\par
Stupid van ! Broke my finger ! I' ve made a horrible mistake . I didn' t mean to destroy you . I mean , I meant to destroy you . I didn' t think it would really work . What are we suppose to do ? Without you , evil is running rampant through the streets . I am so tired of running rampant through the streets . What' s the point of being bad when there' s no good to try and stop you ?\par
Someone has to stop , Megamind . Bernard : Hey , we' re closing soon . Oh , you scared me . - Barry , right ? - Bernard . Bernard , I was just well I was talking to myself . You may think I' m a little bit nuts . I' m not allowed to self guess directly . Thank you , I just ...\par
Bernard , I' il just be another minute . - Okay . - Thanks . I had so many evil plans in the works . The illiteracy beam . Typhoon cheese . Robo sheep . Battles we will now , never have . ( " Never have " echoes ) You know we never had the chance to say goodbye .\par
So , it' s good that we have this time now . You know , before I destroy the place . Nothing personal , it just brings back to many painful memories . Hello , hello ? Roxanne ! That' s a pretty tasteless costume . - Costume ? - Megamind' s head is not that grossly exaggerated . Oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun . How ...\par
Hello , is someone there ? Hello , who' s there ? Whoa ! It' s just you , Bernard . Oh , yes it' s just me . Bernard . Well thank you for letting me stay . Look I wouldn' t stay for more than two minutes and thirty seven seconds if I were you . ( Bangs button ) We' re having the walls and ceiling removed .\par
Wow , that sounds like . Quite the renovation . Guess I' il ride down with you then . I kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes . Yeah , he was really good at those . Oh , if only the world had a reset button . I' ve looked into the reset button . The size is impossible . Oh , Bernard , I didn' t know you had ... feelings . Are you okay ?\par
Metro Man is gone . And now there' s no one left to challenge Megamind . Roxanne : Oh , come on , Bernard . As long as there' s evil good will rise up against it . Ohhh , I wish . I believe someone is going to stand up to Megamind . - You really think so ? - Yeah . I mean , it' s like they say .\par
Heroes aren' t born , they' re made . Heroes can be made . That' s it ! - All you need are the right ingredients . - Yeah . - Bravery . - Yes . - Strength . - Of course . - Determination .\par
- Imperative . And a smidgen of DNA . - With that , anyone can be a hero . - Yeah ! Oh , ho , ho , ho ! I think we should run . Bye . Time to put the past behind us . Only the future ... AHH ! Oh , I' m to close .\par
I' m genuinely scared right now . Oh , I hope no ones seeing this . Create a hero ? Wait , wait , what ? Why would you do that ? So I have someone to fight . Minion , I' m a villain without a hero . A ying , with no yang . A bull fighter with no bull to fight . In other words , I have no purpose .\par
Now , ask me how I' m going to do it . Go on , ask . How are you doing to do it ? I' m going to give someone , I don' t know who yet . Metro Man' s powers . I' m going to train that someone to become Montrocity' s new hero . Over here , follow . And then , finally I' m going to fight that hero . In an epic battle of good and evil . We could put everything back the way it was .\par
When the world was perfect . And rosy . Behold , Minion . Metro Man' s cape . Look closely . Tell me what you see ? Dandruff ? Yes , it' s his DNA . From this , we' il extract the source of Metro Man' s awesome power . Minion :\par
Sir , I think this is a bad idea . Yes , It' s a very wickedly bad idea . For the greater good of man . But I' m saying this is a kind of bad , bad . Okay , you might think it' s good in your bad perception . Oh , you don' t know what' s good for bad . Now we have just one shot at this . We must find a suitable subject . Someone who will do harm to mine . Who puts the welfare of others above their own .\par
What on earth is that ? Seems to be emanating from there , sir . - O- ilo , - Uh , it' s hello . Hello , like that ? - Bernard , it' s Roxanne . - It' s Roxanne . Roxanne : I just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day . - Oh , You' ve inspired me too . - Great !\par
Roxanne : It' s time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can' t push us around . Oh , oh really . She' s so cute . - I' m already hot on his trail . - Uh , huh . And what gives you that idea ? - Uh , sir . - I just found his secret hideout . How did she find my hideout ?\par
Uh , how did you find his hideout ? This is the only building in Metro City with a big observatory on the roof . Okay , there' s no way she' il find the secret entrance . Oh ! There' s a doormat here that say' s ' Secret Entrance ' . - Minion ! - I kept forgetting where it was . She' il discover all our secrets . - Ohh , oh no ! - You dim- witted creation of science .\par
- Roxanne : What ? - Oh , not you Roxanne . No , I was just yelling at my mothers , urn . Don' t do anything , I' il be right there . Hal : Roxanne ? Oh no , not again . Mega- Bernard : Roxanne .\par
- Whoa ! - Oh , I' m glad you' re here . Wait , how did you get here so fast ? Well , I uh . I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called . - In a suit ? - Uh huh . It' s called , ' Formal Speed walking ' . But that' s not important . I better take the lead .\par
This way looks exciting . No , it says , exit . Uh , which is the abbreviation for ' Exciting ' , right ? Roxanne : It' s the mother load . - Wow . - Wow . - Just look at this thing . You know , I really could use your help in deciphering all this . - Really ?\par
- You' re an expert in all things Megamind , right ? - Yes , right . - Together we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it . Are you in ? - Oh , what fun ! - That' s what I want to hear . ( Whispers ) Minion , Code- Send in the brain bots . You know the whole point of a code is ... Oh code- just do it , Minion . Ahh , it' s me you fools !\par
Bernard ! It' s daddy . Megamind ! What have you done with , Bernard ? Oh Bernard ? Oh yes , I' m doing horrible things to that man . I don' t want to get into it but , Lasers , spikes . Oh , please no , not the lasers and the spikes ! You know the drill . Oh no , not the drill .\par
- Let him go . - Or what ? Or I' m going to find out what this weird looking gun does . No don' t ! Don' t shoot that gun . I' il just go get him . Unhand me you fiend ! It , its strength' s to much . Oh , I work out . Argh , it' s really paying off .\par
You' re so fit , and strangely charismatic . Are you okay ? I' ve did my best . But he' s to fantastic . Here , let me carry that heavy gun for you . I got this covered . Let go , it' s mine ! Bernard , run ! Give it to me . Oh no !\par
Roxanne . Who on earth is that ? Roxanne ! Bernard , you were right about that door being exciting . This way . - What are you doing ? This will stop them , here ! Seems a bit extreme , doesn' t it . Just throw it . Daddy' s , sorry .\par
- Wow , that was real exciting . - Yeah . - You were very strong in there . I' ve never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that . What' s going on ? Hal , what happened ? I think a bee flew up my nose . I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you , but like fifty ninjas started to attack me . So I had to beat them all up , and I did ... - and they were all like crying , and stuff .\par
- Wow . Brave one , isn' t he . Who are you ? Oh thi ... , this is Bernard . - He' s my partner . - Partner ? Yes , yes partner . Well look partner , I' m her partner . She doesn' t know what she' s saying . She' s been through a traumatic experience .\par
I' d better take him home . Thanks again , Bernard . I' il call you tomorrow , partner . Yeah , okay . I' d like that . That was weird for everybody . ' Cause you accidentally , hugged him instead of me . Minion : Sir ! Minion :\par
Minion whispers : Code- Did you find out who it was ? Code- get the car . Code- right away , sir . - Bye . - See you tomorrow , Hal . I' il leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later . Megamind : Who is this man , we' ve infused with godlike power ? Ow , ow , whoa ho .\par
Well sir , his name' s Hal Stewart . He' s twenty eight years old . No criminal record . Actually , no records at all . Apparently , this man hasn' t accomplished anything . Not yet , Minion . Not ... ... Yet . Could this day get anymore , funtastic ? So I will just go ahead and defuse him , since this is clearly a mistake . Something much more powerful at work .\par
This is no mistake . It' s destiny . Hal Stewart , prepare for your destiny . Hal ? Hal Stewart ? Am I saying it right ? - Stewart . Is this a robbery ? ' Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me . Oh , look .\par
It' s Hal Stewart . Quick , the spray . - Oops , all out . - Well use the forget- me- stick . Oh , right ! Just look at him . Well , he doesn' t look quite the hero type to me . Oh , you' re such a pill , Minion . The power couldn' t ask for a finer claim . I smell hero .\par
I smell something burning . I think it' s working ! Places , places , places , places ... You have your disguise ? What ? Ah , you look fantastic . Rise , my glorious creation . Rise , and come to Papa . What' s going on ? - Easy my child .\par
- Who are you ? I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice . Megamind : Honor , and nobility . I am your father . So you' re like , my space Dad ? Yeah , I' m like your space Dad . And you are , what ? I' m your space , Step- Mom . I , I had some work done recently .\par
Is this some kind of dream ? This is a dream come true . You' ve been blethed with unfathomamble power . What kind of power ? Unfathamomble . It' s un , without Fathom . - Whoa - Yeah , we' ve come to guide you . On your path to be Montrosity' s new hero . And battle the super genius , of Megamind . I know this is a lot to take in .\par
It may take months for you to come to grips .. No frickin ' way . I wasn' t finished . I' m going to be a hero . I' m going to be a hero . Thee Minion , he' s perfect . * ( E. L. O. ' s Mr. Blue Sky ) * Aaannd , action ! Minion : Someone help me .\par
- I' m okay . Zap , zap , zap . The flames of my evil burn bright . Now you thay thomething cool back at me . Look , it doesn' t even hurt . Don' t even feel it . No , no , no . Slow it down , and stop . I said slow down . Watch out .\par
He' s hopeless . HOPELESS ! - Maybe we should change tactics ? - You think so ? Oh , you know how boys are . They love video games . I can throw a few parts together . Can' t ... wait . LoL , smiley face . Can' t wait for what , sir ?\par
Oh , that was such a funny story . And brilliantly told , by the way . Okay , now you tell one . Bernard , I never knew you were so funny . And , I never heard you laugh before . Yeah , it' s been a while . Feels pretty good . And , exit . * I' il remember you this way . * You don' t get out much , do you ?\par
Fun ! I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid . It was one of my favorite things to do . Now look at it . It' s a dump . Why are we cleaning up the City , sir ? Um , well we don' t want to battle our new hero in a dump , now ... do we ? They' re all back . But how , why ? Maybe Megamind isn' t so bad after all .\par
That' s it . Be free , my beautiful dove . Okay , okay , Metro Man and I , were never a couple . But I thought you two were ... I know , everybody did . It' s just , well he was never really my type . Really ? Okay , now you tell me something . Something you' ve never told anyone . Well , in shh- school .\par
None of the other kids really liked me . I was always last one picked for everything . Hmm , it' s to bad that we didn' t go to the same school . Hal , I think you' re ready for this . Do I have a son ? No , Hal , you make me laugh . It stretches , it' s for you . Hey , what' s the ' T ' stand for ? Titan . Tighten ?\par
What' s that suppose to mean ? It was the only name I could trademark . Oh . Do you have someone special in your life , Hal ? No not yet , but . There' s this really , really good looking one I' ve got my eye on , currently . That' s very good . Romance is very inspiring . - That' s what I hear . - All you have to do , is save her .\par
Mega- space dad : And she' il be yours . - Who want' s Churro' s ? - I do ! Hal : Thanks spaced out , momma . Mega- Space dad : On the count of three , unsheathe your Churro . All together : One , two , three !\par
To Titan . Mega- space dad : Tomorrow , you will fight Megamind . Mega- space dad : And the city will know your name . The City' s parks ' restored to their original glory . The street' s , the safest they' ve been . The banks reopened . Has something happened to Megamind ? Has someone tamed this monster ?\par
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic , and pleasantly confused . Well you seem in a very good mood tonight , sir . Huh ? Oh yes , how long is this going to take ? Just a few alterations , sir . And I will be done with your most terrifying cape yet . I' m calling it , The Black Mambaaaaaaa ... aaaa ... aaa . Black Mamba , perfect . Ooo , gosh I am running late . I have to go .\par
What , where , where are you going , sir ? We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning . We haven' t even tested your big battle suit yet . You attend to the details , Minion . I have to , run a quick errand . You don' t run errands . What' s going on here ? - What ? - Oh , wait a minute . Are you wearing Jean- Paul Gaultier' s , For Him ?\par
It' s just my natural musk . Now , where are the car keys ? Ahhh . This is about Ms. Ritchi , isn' t it . Your going on a date with her . No my main man , get out of town . Oh this is bad , this is bad . You' ve fallen in love with her . You are forgetting your place , Minion . Now give me the keys .\par
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are ? She will never find out . That' s the point of lying . Ahhh ! Honestly , If I didn' t know any better I' d think this was your first day of being evil . NO ! This has gone far enough . Oh , that was really grown up . Sir please , it' s for your own good . Well what do you know .\par
I may not know much , but I do know this . The bad guy doesn' t get the girl . Maybe I don' t want to be the bad guy anymore . You heard me . ( Whispers in fear ) Who are you ? - Now give me the keys . - NO ! My soul purpose in life is to look after you . Well I don' t need you to look after me . What are you ... what are you saying ?\par
- You don' t need me ? - Let me make it clear . Code- I don' t need you . You know what , you know what . Code- I' il just pack my thing and go . Code- Fine ! Code- Fine back . Well good luck on your date . - I will . - That doesn' t even make any sense .\par
I know . I know I am so close , I can feel it . Okay , okay I just have to take a step back . Wait a minute . Roxanne : Titan . What' s a Titan ? My super ears are burning . I usually just hear criminals . You haven' t been naughty , have you ?\par
I' m totally messing with you . I' m totally messing with you . The names Titan . - Titan ? - Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome . What' s your name ? Just kidding , I know everything about you . Oh , oh ! And I brought some flowers , Didn' t know what you liked , so I just grabbed you know , all of them .\par
Okay , you don' t like flowers . Okay , uh , uh , forget the flowers . - What do you want ? - Thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town . - Get to know each other first . - WHOA ! It' s suppose to be very thrilling for you . Just what do you think you' re doing ? Oh are I moving to fast ? You' re probably right .\par
I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic . Saved you . You are lucky to have such a great hero here . Somebody do something ? Oh , right , right . Duh ! I gotcha . That was fun , you almost died . But I saved you . - Aaaah , building !\par
Gotcha ! Whoo , I' m sorry . What were you saying ? I couldn' t hear you over the sound of me saving your life . Put me down , right now ! Okay , all right , all right , hold on . Are you crazy ? I suppose I' m , a little crazy ... about you . Who are you ? Really .\par
Oooh , oooh , right . Well prepare to have your mind blown , little lady . - Hal ? Yeah , isn' t this great ? Now there' s nothing keeping us apart . No , it' s not great . Wow , our first fight . This is so us , we' re like an old married couple . There is no us , okay . There will never be an us .\par
But , I have powers . I have a cape , I' m the good guy . You are a good guy , Hal . But you don' t understand we need to find out why ... - Right now , - This isn' t right . - Listen to me , Hal . - You' re suppose to be with me . I' m trying to warn you , Hal . It' s Tighten . It' s TlGHTEN , not Hal .\par
- Bernard . - Roxanne . - Sorry I' m late . - Wow , your hair looks exciting . Hmm , not the only exciting development of the night . Megamind' s created a new hero . And I know why . It all makes sense now . He missed getting his butt kicked , so he created a new hero to kick it for him . But why did he pick , Hal ?\par
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick . Wow , that' s a lot to take in . It , it boggles my mind . I am extremely boggled . You know , I' m sure we' il get to the bottom of who' s kicking who' s butt . But in the mean time . Let' s enjoy each other' s company . I' m sorry , Bernard . Of course , your right , you know , I could use a breather . To , Bernard .\par
For being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world . To ... being normal . - Roxanne . - Yes ? Say I wasn' t so normal . Say I was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color . As a random , non specific example . Would you still enjoy my company ? Of course , you don' t judge a book by its cover . Oh , that' s a relief to hear .\par
You judge them based on their actions . Well that seems kinda petty , don' t you think . - What , what ? Oh , don' t look at me ! Just , just a technical glitch . Don' t look yet . My bad . Where were we ? Now , now , hold on . YOU !\par
I can explain . ( Growls in anger ) What about everything you just said ? About judging a book by it' s cover . Well let' s take a look at the contents then , shall we ? You destroyed Metro Man . You took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you . Why are you so evil ? Tricking me ? What could you possibly hope to gain ?\par
Wait a minute . Oh , I don' t believe this . Do you really think that I would ever be with you ? ( Softly whispers ) no ... Okay Minion , you were right . I was .... less right . We should stick to what we' re good at . Being bad . Minion ... You there .\par
Yeah , you . Bring out , the ' Black Mamba ' ! Okay , Titan it' s time to go down , in style . I hear there' s a new hero . who dares to challenge my evil . Where is the one they call , Titan ? Challenge me , if you dare . ( Making car motor sounds ) Megamind playfully cries : Oh no , we' re gonna crash . This is embarrassing .\par
Ballsy and incipient . Boneheaded , irresponsible . RUDE ! Unprofessional , that' s what this is . Would Metro Man have kept me waiting ? Of course not , he was a pro . Hey , Megamind . You' re actually the guy I want to see . Also , there' s a door here . Do you have any idea how long I waited for you ?\par
No , no , no , I totally understand what you' re saying . Could you just shut up for one second , I' m trying to beat this level . Were you even planning on showing up ? What' s this ? Where did you get all this stuff ? ( Whispers ) It doesn' t belong to me . You stole it ! - Pretty cool , right . - Oh no , no , no . You' re a hero .\par
Being a hero is for losers . It' s work , work , work twenty four seven , and for what ? I only took the gig to get the girl . And it turns out Roxanne doesn' t want anything to do with me . Roxanne Ritchi ? Yeah , Roxanne Ritchi . I saw her having dinner , and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb . - Ohhhh - Who needs all that noise . That' s why I think , WE should team up . You ?\par
Wait ! What ? With my power , and your big headedness , we could rule the city . - You want to team up ? - I even drew up some new costume designs . - See - Costume design ? You be the brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume , or something . And since I' m the cool one , I' il have like two tanks sword fighting . I can' t believe you . All your gifts all your powers , and you squander them for your own personal gain .\par
- Yes ! - NO ! I ' m the villain , you' re the good guy . I do something bad , and you come and get me . That' s why I created you . Yeah , right . You' re nuts . - Space Dad told me . - Look , I' m your Space Dad . You should be more like Metro Man .\par
You tricked me ? Oh , don' t like that , huh ? Well there' s more . I' m also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne . - No . - And we were smooching up a storm . Mmmore ... Mmmore ... Mmmore . When I get my hands on you I' m gonna , ... YES ! Yes I know .\par
Bring me to justice . Oh god , how I missed this . And the hero strikes the first blow . But evil returns with a backhand . YES ! Come out you little freak ! I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement . You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book . You little blue , twerp . En Garde !\par
Oh , now that' s the spirit . Take , that , parry again ! Now it' s time for some witty back and forth banter . You go first . Look , I' m not sure where to go with that . This one' s for stealing my girlfriend . This one' s for space Dad making a fool out of me . And Megamind ! This one' s for Space , Step- Mom . You lied to her !\par
Oh , well done , I thought that pummeling went really , really well . I mean , I have a few notes . - Notes ? - But they can wait . You can take me to jail now . Oh , no , no , no . I was thinking more like the morgue . - You' re dead ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . This isn' t how you play the game .\par
Game over . Brain Bots . I' m calling time out . Time out , time out ! Brain bots . Initiate the fail safe . Guess what , Buster Brown ? It' s made from Copper . You' re powerless against it . It' s a very safe metal used to defeat ...\par
Metro Man ? You , should stop comparing me to Metro Man . Tighten : You can run Megamind , but you can' t hide . Mayor : We' re saved , we' re saved ! What' s your name , new hero ? - It' s Tighten . - Thank you , thank you . Tighten has freed us .\par
Oh I wouldn' t say free . Tighten : More like , under new management . What do you want ? - Titan' s turned evil . - Congratulations , another one of your genius plans has backfired on you . And why did my doorman let you up ? - Carlos ? - What are you , no , no ! I need your help .\par
Why do you need MY help ? Because you' re the smartest person I know . Well you can' t hide here . Copper should have worked , why didn' t the copper work ? The copper worked perfectly well the last time . Copper ? You' re not making any sense . Look , if we don' t find Titan' s weakness . He' il destroy the whole city . Okay , how can I help ?\par
We need to find answers . You knew Metro Man best . Did he have a hideout , a cave , a solitary fortress of some kind ? Anything that would give us clues . Well , there is one place I know . You gave him these powers , can' t you just take them away ? I can' t , I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car . The night you dumped me . Alone . In the rain .\par
- Did you ever look back ? - NO ! - Oh , my giant blue head . - I guess we' re here . So , this is where he hid it . After all these years . My old shhool house . You know , I think there' s an apology in order , for the other night . Okay that would be nice . But make it quick .\par
We have much more pressing matters to deal with . Wow , can' t believe he kept all this stuff . Aww , I remember when he wore that . Can we try to stay focused here ? Yes of course , you' re right , focused . Come over and look at this . What is it ? What did you find ? Um ..... look ! This glass has ice cubes in it .\par
Yes , that' s what happens when water gets cold . No , what I' m saying is , don' t you think it' s a little odd that the ice hasn' t melted yet ? One of life' s great mysteries . Hey . AAAAAAAAH ! TV News Anchor : We now have a confirmed report . Tighten , first thought to be the City' s new hero , has turned evil . The city has never seen this level of destruction . If only Metro Man were still alive .\par
- You' re alive ? - You' re alive . I' m alive . Roxanne : But .. we .. we saw your skeleton . - You were dead . - Are you a ghost ? There had better be , an amazing explanation for this . Speak , apparition . Okay , okay , okay , okay .\par
You both deserve the truth . It all started back at the observatory . Roxanne was kidnapped , I was gonna stop you . My head wasn' t in the game that day . We were kinda going through the motions . So ... Using my super speed . I decided to go clear my head . Then I realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives . I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling .\par
But I just felt stuck . I began to realize , despite all my powers , each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn' t . A choice . Ever since I can remember I' ve always had to be what the City wanted me to be . But what about what I wanted to do ? Then it suddenly hit me . I do have a choice . I can be whatever I want to be . No one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig . You can' t just quit either .\par
That' s when I got the brilliant idea ... ... to fake my death . Copper drains my powers ! - You' re weakness is copper ? - ( Laughs ) Once your death ray hit . I never felt so alive . So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school . Metro Man was finally dead . And Music Man was born . Music man ?\par
That way I can keep my logo . - WHAT ? - ' Cause of what ? Finally I' m free , to get in touch with my true power . Weaving lyrical magic . Check this out . * I have eyes that can see * * right through leaaadd . * - That' s horrible . - Granted you have talent ,\par
But there' s a mad man out there destroying our ... your city . ( Metal clangs on face ) How could you do this ? The people of the city relied on you , and you deserted them . You left us in the hands of , him ! No offense . No , I' m with you . Look , we need your help . I' m sorry , I really am . Um , I' m , I' m done . You know , little buddy .\par
There' s a Ying for every Yang . Metro Man : If there' s bad , good will rise up against it . Metro Man : It' s taken me a long time to find my calling . Now it' s about time , you find yours . Roxanne : Hey , who needs him . Roxanne : We can beat Tighten ourselves .\par
I say we go back to the evil lair . Grab some ray guns , hold them sideways , and just go all gangsta on ' em . We can' t So that' s it ? You' re just giving up ? I' m the bad guy . I don' t save the day . I don' t fly off into the sunset , and I don' t get the girl . I' m going home . TV reporter :\par
Unless someone comes to our aid soon , all may be lost . Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus . Remaining citizens are warned , to stay indoors until further notice . Authorities have issued a warning , to stay out of the downtown area at all costs . Hal ! Hal ! Let me guess , after seeing how awesome I am , you' ve finally come to your senses . Well , I' m over you . I' ve come to stop you , Hal . You ?\par
Oh , well . Okay , what are you going to do , report me to death ? I was going to try reasoning with you . You and I , we worked together for a long time . I know you . You don' t know me . You never took the time to know me . This is the first time we' ve hung out socially . And it' s when I' m about to destroy the city . I want to talk to the real Hal .\par
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man , and eating dip , And being a nerd and being not as scary as the Tighten- Hal . To late ! Megamind . You and I have some unfinished business . I' il be waiting at Metro Tower , oh , and just so you don' t get cold feet . Roxanne ! Come on Roxi , call for your hero to come rescue you . Megamind . I don' t even know if you' re listening , but if you are ...\par
You can' t give up . The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight . Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning . It was your best quality . You need to be that guy , right now . The city needs you . I need you . Roxanne . You have one hour . Don' t ... keep me waiting .\par
Warden , Warden ! Listen to me , you have to let me go . Tighten has to be stopped . Sorry Megamind , you still have 88 life sentences to go . Plenty of time to reflect on what you' ve done . If you want to hear me say it ? I' il say it . Here it is . From the blackest part of my heart . I .... AM .... Sorry !\par
Not buying it . I don' t blame you . Megamind : I' ve terrorized the city countless times . Created a hero who' s turned out to be a villain . I lied to Roxanne . My best friend , Minion . I treated like dirt . Please , don' t make this city , don' t make Roxanne pay for my wrong doings . Apology accepted .\par
Uh , Minion . You fantastic fish , you . What are we waiting for ? We' d better get going . You got me ! Good luck , fellows . Megamind : We' re gonna die ! Minion : Wait , what ?\par
Hey , Metro losers . This is Metro Tower . Tighten : They say it' s suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength . But , for me , it' s a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart . And I hate reminders . HAL ! Please don' t do this . I know there' s still good in you , Hal . You' re so naive , Roxie .\par
You see the good in everybody , even when it' s not there . You' re living a fantasy . There is no Easter bunny . There is no tooth fairy . And there is no Queen of England . This is the real world . And you need to wake up . You dare challenge Megamind ? This town isn' t big enough for two super villains . Megamind :\par
Oh , you' re a villain all right . Just not a super one . Yeah , what' s the difference ? PRESENTATlON ! I knew you' d come back . Well , that makes one of us . - What' s the plan ? - Well , mostly involves , not dying . I , like that plan . I can' t control it .\par
No ! Well , that was easy . Looks like there' s only one loose end now . Please , let' s have a little respect for public transportation . You came back . You were right , Roxanne . I never should have left . Whoa , I ... I thought you were dead . My death was , greatly exaggerated . So , you' re the punk I' ve heard about .\par
I' m sorry , I did the best I could . I' m so proud of you . Minion ? Surprise ! Heh , heh , heh . He' s the real hero . Megamind . Going somewhere ? Besides jail . No , not in the face man , please .\par
If you know what' s good for you , Tighten . You' il stay out of Montrosity . - You got it ! - For good . Pretty sneaky , sis . But there is only one person I know who calls this town , Montrosity . Ooops . You ! Bet you think it' s really funny , huh ? Let' s all laugh at the really cool guy , huh .\par
You' re not going to be laughing for long . The invisible car . Hey , remember that night that I dumped you ? You are bringing this up now ? I did look back . You did ? YOU DlD ! Yes , and you should look back , right now . Oh , I get it . This is the last time you' il make a fool out of me .\par
I made you a hero . You did the fool thing , all by yourself . You' re so pathetic . No matter what side you' re on . You' re always the looser . There' s a benefit to loosing . You get to learn from your mistakes . Oh , you' ve got to be kidding me ! Minion , if I live , I will kill you . Enjoy your flight .\par
Megamind . Megamind Narrates : So , this is how it ends . Normally I' d chalk this up to my last glorious failure . But not today ! What can I say ? Old habits die hard . Say bye , bye Roxie . Ollo . Thing about bad guys , they always LOOSE !\par
We did it , you won . Well , I finally had a reason to win . You . MlNION ! Can' t see it' s cold and ... warm , and dark and light . It' s me , Minion . I' m right here . We' ve had a lot of adventures together . You and I. We have , Minion .\par
I mean ... most of them ended in horrible failure , but , We won today . Didn' t we , sir ? Yes Minion , we did it . Thanks to you . Code- We' re the good guys now . Code- I guess we are . I' m going ... I think this ... This is it , I mean I' m going far awa ... ( Gasps ) Oh , what a drama queen .\par
You know , I' m feeling much better now . I guess I just needed a swim - He had you , didn' t he . - Whew ! Classic , Minion . Don' t give them the face . Megamind : There he is with that little face . Look at that face . We did it !\par
We did it ! - Fist pump ! - You did it ! We won , we won , we won . What ! Get back you savages ! Sorry , sorry . He' s just not used to positive feedback . Funny , I guess destiny is not the path given to us . But the path we choose for ourselves .\par
All right , put your hands in the air . Now hand over your wallets . I' m just kidding . Just kidding . I have to admit . Being good , has its perks . You know , you look pretty good in white . Megamind , if you please . Uh , hey , my kid can' t see . Sorry my friend .\par
Way to go , little buddy . I knew you had it in you . Mayor : Ladies and gentlemen ... MEGAMlND ! Defender of Metro City . You know , I like the sound of that . Hit it ! * You Know I' m Bad , I' m Bad - come on . * * You Know I' m Bad , I' m Bad - you know it . * - Hal :\par
* Who' s bad ! * Here' s my day so far : went to jail , lost the girl of my dreams , and got my butt kicked pretty good . Still , things could be a lot worse . Oh , that' s right . I' m falling to my death . Guess they can' t . How' d it all come to this , you ask ? My end starts at the beginning . The very beginning . Yes , that' s me .\par
I had a fairly standard childhood . I came from , what you might call , a broken home . Literally broken . I was eight days old and still living with my parents . How sad is that ? Clearly it was time to move on . Here is your minion . He will take care of you . And here is your binky . You are destined for ...\par
I didn' t quite hear that last part , but it sounded important . - ... two , one . - Destined for what ? I set out to find my destiny . Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea . That was the day I met Mr. Goody Two- Shoes ... ... and our glorious rivalry was born . Could this be what I was destined for ? A dream life filled with luxury . Apparently not . Even fate picks its favorites . No big deal .\par
A much different fate awaited me . A baby ! How thoughtful . Oh , yes . Yes , I saw it and thought of you . Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home . Can we keep it ? A place that taught me the differences between right ... ... and wrong . Mr. Goody Two- Shoes , on the other hand , had life handed to him on a silver platter . Our baby can fly .\par
Yes , yes , nothing but the best for you , darling . The power of flight , invulnerability , and great hair . But I had something far , far greater . My amazing intellect ... ... and knack for building objects of mayhem . After a few years , and with some time off for good behavior , I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning ... ... at a strange place called shool . It was there that I once again ran into Mr. Goody Two- Shoes . He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies . He bought their affections with showmanship and extravagant gifts of deliciousness . So I , too , will make this popp- ed corn and win over those mindless drones .\par
Lights out . That' s when I learned a very hard lesson : Good receives all the praise and adulation , while evil is sent to quiet- time in the corner . So fitting in wasn' t really an option . While they were learning the Itsy Bitsy Spider ... ... I learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will . Some days , it felt like it was just me and Minion against the world . No matter how hard I tried , I was always the odd man out , the last one picked , the screw- up , the black sheep ... Get him ! - ... the bad boy . - Freak !\par
Was this my destiny ? Wait , maybe it was . Being bad is the one thing I' m good at . Then it hit me : If I was the bad boy , then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all . I was destined to be a super- villain , and we were destined to be rivals . The die had been cast , and so began an enduring , epic , lifelong career . And I loved it . Our battles quickly got more elaborate . He would win some .\par
I would almost win others . He took the name Metro Man , defender of Metrocity . I decided to pick something a little more humble : Megamind ... ... incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy . Read on your own time . Open up . Oh , good morning , Warden . Great news : I' m a changed man , and ... ... and I' m ready to re- enter society as a solid citizen . You' re a villain , and you' il always be a villain .\par
You' il never change , and you' il never leave . You' re fun . You got a present in the mail . Is it a puppy ? From Metro Man . " To count every second of your 85 life sentences . " That' s funny . Never thought Metro Man was the gloating type . Oh , but he does have nice taste . I think I' il keep it .\par
Any chance you could give me the time ? I don' t want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man Museum . Oh no . Looks like you' re gonna miss it , by several thousand years . Oh , am I ? Happy Metro Man Day , Metro City . It' s a beautiful day in beautiful downtown , where we' re here to honor a beautiful man , Metro Man . His heart is an ocean that' s inside a bigger ocean . For years he' s been watching us with his super- vision , saving us with his super- strength and caring for us with his super- heart . Now it' s our turn to give something back .\par
This is Roxanne Ritchi , reporting live from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum . OK , the stuff they make you read on- air , that' s un- freaking- believable . It' s crazy . I wrote that piece myself , Hal . What I was trying to say was , I can' t believe that in our modern society , they let , like , actual art get onto the news . - Nice save , Hal . - What are we ... Like , let' s just get a coffee or something . Come on , it' s time to get in the Metro Man Day spirit .\par
Well , if I were Metro Man , Megamind wouldn' t be kidnapping you all the time . - That' s the first thing . - That' s sweet , Hal . And I' d be watching you , like a dingo watches a human baby . OK , that sounded ... - OK , that sounded a little weird . - A little bit . Yeah . And you' re making a weird face , and that' s making me feel weird .\par
The point is , I would watch you like someone ... Not love . We' re not in love . I' m not saying I love you . Hey , I love you . Whatever . But I' m not saying like I' m in love with you . I' m saying ... Roxanne ? Roxaroo ?\par
Get back to work . The city doesn' t pay you to loaf . - Freeze ! - Whoa . What are you doing , guys ? It' s me ! It' s the warden . Hey ! Open up ! No , you fools .\par
He' s tricked us . You were right . I' il always be a villain . Well , hello good- looking . Need a lift ? Certainly do , you fantastic fish , you . - Get in the car , you . - I' m free ! Right ? Nice work sending me the watch , Minion .\par
- You got it , boss . - Punch it ! All right , put your hands in the air . Ladies and gentlemen , your Metro Man ! - Who' s your man ? Yeah , Metro City ! Gimme some . Come on . Give it now . Give it to me .\par
Right on . Gimme the good stuff . All right . Hey , Metro City . Hey . Hey . You know , you know , I just want to bring it down a bit . Boys , a little lower . Thank you , fellas . Let' s get real for a moment .\par
That' s right . That' s right . That' s right . Although getting a whole museum is super- cool , is super- cool , you want to know what the greatest honor you' ve given me is ? Do you really want to know ? Really ? I' il tell you . The greatest honor you' ve given me is letting me serve you , the helpless people of Metro City . And at the end of every day , well , I often ask myself ... ... who would I be without you ? - I love you , Metro Man !\par
- And I love you , random citizen . I tell you , Minion . There' s no place like evil lair . I' ve kept it cold and damp just for you , sir . How do I look , Minion ? Do I look bad ? Disgustingly horrifying , sir . You always know what to say . Oh , the brain- bots certainly missed you , sir . Did you miss your daddy ?\par
Who' s a menacing little cyborg ? You are . Yes , you are . No biting . No , no , no , no , no , no . You want the wrench ? Go get the wrench . - Oh , look at that . - Now , back to laughing . She' s awake .\par
Quick , to work . Miss Ritchi , we meet again . Would it kill you to wash the bag ? You can scream all you wish , Miss Ritchi . I' m afraid no one can hear you . Why isn' t she screaming ? Miss Ritchi , if you don' t mind ? Like this ... But that' s , that' s a poor lady scream . He' s a little better .\par
Is there some kind of nerdy super- villain website where you get Tesla coils and blinky dials ? Actually , most of it comes from an outlet store in ... Don' t answer that . - Romania . - Don' t ! Stop ! She' s using her nosy reporter skills on your weak- willed mind to find out all our secrets . Such tricks won' t work on me ... - Please talk slower . - ... temptress . What secrets ?\par
You' re so predictable . Predictable ? Predictable ? Oh , you call this predictable ? Your alligators . Yes . Yeah , I was thinking about it on the way over . What' s this ? Boom ! In your face .\par
- Clich\'c3\'a9 . - No ! Look , watch . - Juvenile . - Shock and awe . - Tacky . - Oh , it' s so scary ! - Seen it . - What' s this one do ? Garish .\par
- OK , the spider' s new . - Spider ? Yes . The ... The spee- ider . Even the smallest bite from Arachnis deathicus will instantly paralyze ... Get it off ! It bit me ! Give it up , Megamind . Your plans never work .\par
Let' s stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights , shall we ? It is with great pleasure that I present to Metro Man his new museum . If you please . - Hey ! My kid can' t see . - Megamind ! - Oh , bravo , Metro Man . Boo ! Yes , I can play along too . Boo !\par
Should' ve known you' d try to crash the party . Oh , I intend to do more than crash it . This is a day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget . It' s pronounced Metro City ! Potato- tomato , potato- tomato . We all know how this ends : with you behind bars . I' m shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots . You will leave Metrocity , or this will be the last you ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi . Roxanne ! Don' t panic , Roxie .\par
- I' m on my way . - Yeah , I' m not panicking . In order to stop me , you need to find me first , Metro Man . We' re at the abandoned observatory . No , we' re not ! Don' t listen to her . She' s crazy . Metro Man approaching , sir . Hold on a second . Oh , good heavens !\par
You didn' t think you were in the real observatory , did you ? Ready the death ray , Minion . Death ray , readying . Over here , old friend . In case you haven' t noticed , you' ve fallen right into my trap . You can' t trap justice . It' s an idea , a belief . Even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time . Justice is a non- corrosive metal . But metals can be melted by the heat of revange .\par
It' s " revenge , " and it' s best served cold . But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil . Well , I think your warranty is about to expire . Maybe I got an extended warranty . Warranties are invalid if you don' t use the product for its intended purpose . Oh , girls , girls , you' re both pretty . Can I go home now ? Of course . That is , if Metro Man can withstand the full , concentrated power of the sun ! Fire !\par
Minion . Fire ? - It' s still warming up , sir . - Come again ? - Warming up , sir . - Warming up ? The sun is warming up ? One second more and ... ... just tippy- tappy tippy- tap- tap , tip- top more , - and we are ready in just ... - Honestly !\par
On my way , Roxie . I told you to have things ready . I told you countless times . Why do you always blame me ? My spider bite is acting up . Your plan is failing . Just admit it . Yeah , good luck with that one . Whose side are you on ? - The losing side .\par
- Thank you . Could someone stamp my Frequent Kidnapping Card ? You of all people know we discontinued that promotion . - Ciao- ciao , all ! - Same time next week ? Crab nuggets ! - What did he just say ? - " Crab nuggets " ? - Good lord , I' m trapped . - Ten ...\par
- What kind of trickery is this ? - ... nine ... - You mad genius . - ... eight ... - Your dark gift has finally paid off . - ... seven ... - It ... It has ? - ... six ... This dome is obviously lined with copper . - Yeah ? So ? - Sir ... - Copper drains my powers . - ... two ...\par
- Your weakness is copper ? - ... one . - You' re kidding , right ? - Full power . I don' t think even he could survive that . Well , let' s not get our hopes up just yet . - Look ! - Metro Man ! Metro Man . Metro Man ! You did it , sir .\par
- I did it ? He did it . - I did it ? - He did it . - You did it , sir . - I did it ! - You did it ! - I did it ! Metrocity is mine ! - You did it , sir !\par
- I did it ! Yeah , me , me ! - Yes , I did it ! - Us ! We both did it ! - Not us ! I ! - You , a little more - than me but still , come on ! - A lot more than you .\par
When they' re giving out the awards , - I' m gonna be right there next to you . - What awards ? Hit it ! Drop ' em ! First off , what a turnout . How wild is this ? All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe . Are there any questions ? Go on .\par
Yes ! You in the back . I' m sure we' d all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city . Good , I' m glad you asked that . Imagine the most horrible , terrifying , evil thing you can possibly think of , and multiply it ... by six ! In the meantime , I want you to carry on with the dreary , normal things you normal people do . Let' s just have fun with this . Come on . And I will get back to you .\par
Now slam the door really hard . They ... They can still see you . - Now ? - Your elbow' s still in . There he is , Mr. Evil Overlord Oh , Minion , did you think this day would ever come ? No way . Not at all , sir . Never .\par
Never in a million ... I mean ... - Yes , I did . - Look at the intricate mouldings . I' m looking . I' m looking . And what' s this ? It' s like one of the giant monitors in the lair . But it seems to only carry one station . Oh , that , sir , is called a window .\par
- Window ? - All the kids are looking through them . I' ve never had a view before . Metrocity , Minion , it' s all mine . If my parents could see me now . Sir , I' m sure they' re smiling down from evil heaven . And now that Mr. Goody Two- Shoes is out of the way , I can have everything I want , and there' s no one to stop me ! I know . I know .\par
Always thirsty , never satisfied . I understand you , little well- dressed bird . Purposeless , emptiness . It' s a vacuum , isn' t it ? It' s ... What' s your vacuum like ? Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Not now , Minion . I' m in a heated , existential discussion with this dead- eyed , plastic desk toy . Is something wrong , sir ?\par
Just think about it . We have it all . Yet , we have nothing . It' s just too easy now . I' m sorry , you' ve lost me , sir . I mean , we did it , right ? Well , you did it , sir . Yes , you' ve made that perfectly clear . Then why do I feel so ... mel- on- choly . " Mel- on- choly " ?\par
- Unhappy . What if tomorrow , we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi . That always seems to lift your spirits . Good idea , Minion . But without him , what' s the point ? - " Him , " sir ? - Nothing . We' il just ... that' s something to consider ... ... and ... Well , I think I' il just power down for a while then . He was always there for us .\par
Dependable . Perhaps we took him for granted . You know , maybe , we never really know how good we have it until it' s gone . We miss you , Metro Man . I miss you . And I have just one question for Megamind : Are you happy now ? This is Roxanne Ritchi , reporting from a city without a hero . Coming up next , are you ready to be a slave army ? What you need to know .\par
And ... wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas , - ' cause we' re done . - OK . See you tomorrow , Hal . Wait . Roxie , I' m having a party at my house . It' s gonna be , like , off the hook , or whatever . You should come over . I got a deejay , rented a bouncy house , made a gallon of dip . It' s gonna be sick .\par
Oh . I ... I don' t know , Hal . I don' t really feel like being around a bunch of people . No , no , no , that' s the best part . It' il just be like you and me . That ... that' s certainly very tempting , but ... I did hire a wedding photographer . That' s just in case we were like , something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it . Like , maybe we should have this for , like , ever .\par
Like a memory , you know ? I' m gonna pass . I have some work here that I need to do , anyway . Cool . So Thursday ? Soft Thursday ? - Good night , Hal . - That' s a soft yes on Thursday . What' s wrong with me ? Rented a bouncy house ?\par
Chicks don' t like bouncy houses . They like clowns . Stupid van ! You broke my finger ! I' ve made a horrible mistake . I didn' t mean to destroy you . I mean , I meant to destroy you , but I didn' t think it would really work . What are we supposed to do ? Without you , evil is running rampant through the streets . I' m so tired of running rampant through the streets .\par
What' s the point of being bad when there' s no good to try and stop you ? Someone has to stop Megamind . - Hey , we' re closing soon . - You scared me . - Barry , right ? - Bernard . Bernard . I was just ... Well , I was talking to myself . You probably think I' m a little bit nuts .\par
I' m not allowed to insult guests directly . Thank you . Just ... Bernard , I' il just be another minute . OK . Thanks . I had so many evil plans in the works . The illiteracy beam . Typhoon cheese . Robo- sheep .\par
Battles we will now never have . You know , I never had the chance to say goodbye . So it' s good that we have this time now . You know , before I destroy the place . Nothing personal , it just brings back too many painful memories . Hello ? - Hello ? - Roxanne . - That' s a pretty tasteless costume . - Costume ?\par
Megamind' s head is not that grossly exaggerated . And you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun . How ... Hello ? Is someone there ? Who' s there ? It' s just you , Bernard . Yes . It' s just me . Bernard .\par
Well , thank you for letting me stay . Look , I wouldn' t stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds if I were you . We' re having the walls and ceiling removed . Wow , that sounds like quite the renovation . I guess I' il catch a ride down with you then . I kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last- minute escapes . He was really good at those . Oh , if only the world had a reset button . I' ve looked into the reset button . The science is impossible .\par
Oh , Bernard ... I didn' t know you had ... feelings . Are you OK ? Metro Man' s gone . And now there' s no one left to challenge Megamind . Oh , come on , Bernard . As long as there' s evil , good will rise up against it . Oh , I wish . I believe someone is gonna stand up to Megamind . - You really think so ?\par
- Yeah . I mean , it' s like they say , " Heroes aren' t born , they' re made . " Heroes can be made . That' s it ! All you need are the right ingredients . - Yeah . Bravery . - Yes . - Strength .\par
- Of course . - Determination . - Imperative ! And a smidgen of DNA . Oh , with that , anyone can be a hero ! Yeah ! I think we should run ! Bye ! Time to put the past behind us . Only the future ...\par
I' m too close ! I' m genuinely scared right now . I hope no one' s seeing this ! Create a hero ? Wait , wait , what ? Why would you do that ? So I have someone to fight . Minion , I' m a villain without a hero . A ying with no yang . A bullfighter with no bull to fight .\par
In other words , I have no purpose . Now , ask me how I' m going to do it . Go on ! Ask ! How are you gonna do it ? I' m going to give someone ... I don' t know who yet ... Metro Man' s powers . I' m going to train that someone to become Metrocity' s new hero . Over here !\par
Follow ! And then finally , I' m going to fight that hero in an epic battle of good and evil . Which will put everything back the way it was ... ... when the world was perfect and rosy . Behold , Minion , Metro Man' s cape . Look closely . Tell me what you see . - Dandruff ? - Yes . It' s his DNA . From this , we' il extract the source of Metro Man' s awesome power .\par
Sir , I think this is a bad idea . Yes ! This is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of man . But I' m saying this is a kind of bad that ... ... OK , you might think is good in your bad perception , but from a good perception it ... it' s just plain bad . Oh , you don' t know what' s good for bad . Now , we have just one shot at this . We must find a suitable subject , someone of noble heart and mind . Who puts the welfare of others above their own . What on Earth is that ? It seems to be emanating from there , sir .\par
Ollo . It' s " Hello . " Hello ? Like that ? - Bernard , it' s Roxanne . - It' s Roxanne . I just wanted to thank you for inspiring me the other day . - Oh , you inspired me too . - Great ! It' s time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can' t push us around .\par
Oh , really ? She' s so cute . I' m already hot on his trail . - And what gives you that idea ? - Sir ? I just found his secret hideout . How did she find my hideout ? ! How did you find his hideout ? This is the only building in Metro City with a fake observatory on the roof . There' s no way she' il find the secret entrance .\par
There' s a doormat here that says " Secrit Entrance " ! - Minion ! - I kept forgetting where it was . She' il discover all our secrets ! - Oh , no ! - You dim- witted creation of science ! - What ? - What ? Oh , no , not you , Roxanne . No , I was just yelling at my ... mother' s urn .\par
Don' t do anything . I' il be right there . Roxanne ? Oh no , not again ! Roxanne ? I' m glad you' re here . Wait , how did you get here so fast ? Well , I ... I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called . In a suit ?\par
It' s called ... formal speed walking , but that' s not important . I better take the lead . This way looks exciting . No , it says " Exit . " Which is the abbreviation for " exciting , " right ? This is the mother lode ! Just look at this thing . - Wow . You know , I really could use your help in deciphering all this . - Really ?\par
- You' re an expert - on all things Megamind , right ? - Yes . Right . Together , we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it . - Are you in ? - Oh , what fun ! That' s what I want to hear . Minion , Code : Send In The Brain- bots .\par
You know , the whole point of a code is ... Oh , Code : Just Do It , Minion . - It' s me , you fools ! - Bernard ! It' s Daddy ! Megamind . - What have you done with Bernard ? - Oh , Bernard ? Oh , yes .\par
I' m doing horrible things to that man . I don' t want to get into it , but lasers , spikes . No , please ! No ! Not the lasers and the spikes ! - You know the drill . - Oh , no ! Not the drill ! - Let him go or ... - Or what ?\par
Or I' m gonna find out what this weird- looking gun does . No , don' t shoot ! Don' t shoot that gun ! I' il just go get him . - Unhand me , you fiend ! - Never ! His strength' s too much ! Oh , I work out ! Well , it' s really paying off ! You' re so fit , and strangely charismatic .\par
Are you OK ? I did my best , but he' s too fantastic . Here . Let me carry that heavy gun for you . I got us covered . - Let go . It' s mine ! - Bernard , run ! Roxanne ? - You' re going to break it !\par
- Give it to me ! Oh , no ! Roxanne ? ! Who on Earth is that ? - Help ! - Roxanne ! Bernard ! You were right about that door being exciting . - Intruder ! Intruder !\par
- This way . Intruder ! What are you doing ? This' il stop them . Here ! Seems a bit extreme , doesn' t it ? - Just throw it ! - Daddy' s sorry . That was really exciting . - Yeah .\par
- You were very strong in there . I' ve never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that . - What' s going on ? - Hal , what happened ? I think a bee flew up my nose . I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you , but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me , so I had to beat ' em all up , and I did , and I ... They were all , like , crying and stuff ... - Wow , a brave one , isn' t he ? - Who are you ? Oh , thi ... this is Bernard .\par
He' s my partner . - Partner ? - Yes . Yes . Partner . Well , look , " partner , " I' m her partner . She doesn' t know what she' s saying . She' s been through a traumatic experience . I' d better take him home . Thanks again , Bernard .\par
I' il call you tomorrow , partner . Yeah , OK . I' d like that . That was weird for everybody , ' cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me . Sir ? Sir ! Code : Did You Find Out Who It Was ? Code :\par
Get The Car . Code : Right Away , Sir . - Bye- bye ! - See you tomorrow , Hal . I' il leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later . Who is this man we' ve infused with godlike power ? Well , sir , his name' s Hal Stewart . He' s 28 years old . No criminal record .\par
Actually no records at all . Apparently this man hasn' t accomplished anything . Not yet , Minion . Not ... yet . Could this day get anymore fun- tastic ? So , I will just go ahead and diffuse him since this is clearly a mistake . No , Minion ! There' s something much more powerful at work here . This is no mistake . It' s destiny .\par
Hal Shtewart ! Prepare for your destiny ! Hal ? Hal Shtewart ? In the bed ! - Am I saying it right ? " Stewart . " Is this a robbery ? ' Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me . Oh , look , it' s Hal Stewart .\par
Quick , the spray . All out . - Well , use the Forget- Me Stick . - Oh , right . Just look at him . No , he doesn' t look quite the hero- type to me . Oh , you' re such a pill , Minion . A potter couldn' t ask for finer clay . I smell a hero . I smell something burning .\par
I think it' s working . Places ! Places ! Places ! Places ! Do you have your disguise ? What ? Oh , you look fantastic . Rise my glorious creation . Rise , and come to Papa .\par
- What' s going on ? - Easy my child . - Who are you ? - I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice , honor , and nobility . I am your father . So you' re like my space dad ? Yeah , I' m like your space dad . And you are what ? I' m your space stepmom . I' ve had some work done recently .\par
Is this some kind of dream ? This is a dream come true . You' ve been blessed with unfathomable power . - What kind of power ? - Unfathomable . It' s unf ... without fathom . We' ve come to guide you on your path to be Metrocity' s new hero and battle the super- genius of Megamind . I know this is a lot to take in . It may take months for you to come to grips . No freaking way !\par
I wasn' t finished . I' m gonna be a hero ! I' m gonna be a hero ! See , Minion , he' s perfect ! And ... action ! - Someone help me ! - I' m OK ! Zap ! Zap ! Zap !\par
The flames of my evil burn bright . Now you say something cool back at me . Look . It doesn' t even hurt . Don' t even feel it . No , no , no , no , no . Stomach down , hands up . Like Metro Man . - Whoa ! Wait !\par
- Watch out . He' s hopeless . Hopeless ! - Maybe we should change tactics . - You think so ? Oh , you know how boys are . They love video games . - I could throw a few parts together . - Can' t wait . LOL .\par
Smiley face . Can' t wait for what , sir ? That was such a funny story . And brilliantly told , by the way . OK , now you tell one . Bernard , I never knew you were so funny . And I never heard you laugh before . Yeah , it' s been a while . Feels pretty good . And action .\par
- You don' t get out much , do you ? - Oh , what fun ! I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid . It was one of my favorite things to do . Now look at it . It' s a dump . Why are we cleaning up the city , sir ? Well , we don' t want to battle our new hero in a dump now , do we ? They' re all back . But how ?\par
Why ? Maybe Megamind isn' t so bad after all . That' s it . Be free , my beautiful dove ! OK , OK . Metro Man and I were never a couple . - But I thought you two were ... - I know . Everybody did . It' s just ...\par
Well , he was never really my type . Really ? OK , now you tell me something . Something you' ve never told anyone . Well , in sh ... school ... ... none of the other kids really liked me . I was always the last one picked for everything . It' s too bad that we didn' t go to the same school . Hal , I think you' re ready for this . - Do I have a son ? - No .\par
You make me laugh . It stretches . It' s for you . Hey , what' s the T stand for ? Titan . " Titan " ? What' s that supposed to mean ? It was the only name I could trademark . Do you have someone special in your life , Hal ? No , not yet .\par
But ... there' s this really , really good- looking one I' ve got my eye on currently . That' s very good . - Romance is very inspiring . - That' s what I hear . All you have to do is save her and she' il be yours . - Who wants churros ? - I do ! - I do , yeah . Thanks , Space Stepmom .\par
- Churros all the way around . On the count of three , unsheathe your churro . One , two , three ! To Titan ! Tomorrow , you will fight Megamind , and the city will know your name . ... the city' s parks restored to their original glory , the streets the safest they' ve been , the banks reopened . Has something happened to Megamind ? Has someone tamed this monster ? This is Roxanne Ritchi , cautiously optimistic , and pleasantly confused . Well , you seem in a very good mood tonight , sir .\par
Oh , yes . How long is this going to take , Minion ? Just a few alterations , sir , and I will be done with your most terrifying cape yet ! I' m calling it ... ... the Black Mamba ... Black Mamba . Perfect . Gosh , I am running late . I have to go . What ? Where ...\par
Where are you going , sir ? We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning . We haven' t even tested your big battle suit yet . You attend to the details , Minion . I have to ... run a quick errand . You don' t run errands . - What' s going on here ? - What ? Oh , wait a minute . Are you wearing Jean Paul Gaultier' s Pour Homme ?\par
It' s just my natural musk . Now , where are the car keys ? This is about Ms. Ritchi , isn' t it ? You' re going on a date with her . No , my main man . Get out of town . Oh , this is bad . This is bad . You' ve fallen in love with her . You are forgetting your place , Minion .\par
Now give me the keys . What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are ? She will never find out . That' s the point of lying . Honestly , if I didn' t know any better , I' d think this was your first day of being evil . No ! This has gone far enough ! Oh , that was really grown- up ! Sir , sir , please .\par
It' s for your own good . Oh , what do you know ? I may not know much , but I do know this : The bad guy doesn' t get the girl . Maybe I don' t want to be the bad guy anymore . You heard me ! Who are you ? - Now , give me the keys ! - No ! My sole purpose in life is to look after you .\par
Well , I don' t need you to look after me . What are you s ... What are you saying ? You don' t need me ? Let me make it clear . Code : I Don' t Need You . You know what ? You know what ? Code :\par
I' il Just Pack My Thing And Go ! - Code : Fine ! - Code : Fine Back ! - Well , good luck on your date ! - I will ! - That doesn' t even make any sense ! - I know ! I know I am so close .\par
I can feel it . OK , OK . I just have to take a step back . Wait a minute . " Titan . " - What' s a Titan ? - My super- ears are burning . I usually just hear criminals . You haven' t been naughty , have you ? I' m totally messing with you .\par
I' m totally messing with you . - The name' s Titan . - Titan . Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome . What' s your name ? Just kidding . I know everything about you . And I ... And I brought some flowers . Didn' t know what you liked , so I just grabbed , you know , all of them .\par
OK . You don' t like flowers ? OK , forget the flowers . What do you want ? Thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town . Get to know each other first . This must be very thrilling for you . What do you think you' re doing ? ! Oh , am I moving too fast ? You' re probably right .\par
I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic . Saved ya . You are lucky to have such a great hero here . - Oh , no ! Somebody do something ! Oh , right , right , duh . I gotcha . That was a close one . You almost died , - but I saved you .\par
- Building ! Gotcha ! I' m sorry . What were you saying ? I couldn' t hear you over the sound of me saving your life . Put me down ! Right now ! OK , all right . All right , hold on . Are you crazy ?\par
I suppose I' m a , I' m a little crazy , about you . Who are you , really ? Oh , right . Well , prepare to have your mind blown , little lady . - Ta- da . - Hal ? Yeah . Isn' t this great ? Now there' s nothing keeping us apart . - No .\par
It' s not great . - Wow . Our first fight . This is so us . We' re like an old married couple . Look , there is no " us , " OK ? There will never be an " us . " But ... I have powers . I have a cape .\par
I' m the good guy . You are a good guy , Hal , but you don' t understand . - We need to find out why ... - No , no . This ... - Hal , just take a deep breath - This isn' t right ! - and listen to me for a moment . I' m trying to warn you , Hal . It' s Titan ! It' s Titan , not Hal ! - Bernard .\par
- Roxanne . - Sorry I' m late . - Wow , your hair looks exciting . Not the only exciting development of the night . Megamind' s created a new hero , and I know why . It all makes sense now . He missed getting his butt kicked , so he created a new hero - to kick it for him . - Yeah . But why would he pick Hal ?\par
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick . Wow . That' s a lot to take in . It boggles my mind . I am extremely boggled . You know , I' m sure we' il get to the bottom of who' s kicking whose butt . But in the meantime , let' s enjoy each other' s company . I' m sorry , Bernard , of course , you' re right . You know , I could use a breather . To Bernard , for being the only normal thing in my crazy , upside- down world .\par
To ... being normal . - Roxanne ? - Yes ? Say I wasn' t so normal . Let' s say I was bald and had the complexion of , of a popular primary color , as a random , nonspecific example . - Would you still enjoy my company ? - Of course ! You don' t judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside . That' s a relief to hear . You judge them based on their actions .\par
Well , that seems kind of petty , don' t you think ? What ? What ? Don' t look at me ! Just a technical glitch ! Don' t look yet ! Well , never mind that . Where were we ? - Now , now , hold on . You !\par
I can explain ! What about everything you just said ? About judging a book by its cover ? Well , let' s take a look at the contents then , shall we ? You destroyed Metro Man , you took over the city , and then , you actually got me to care about you ! Why are you so evil ? Tricking me ? What could you possibly hope to gain ? Wait a minute . I don' t believe this .\par
Do you really think that I would ever be with you ? No . OK , Minion ! You were right ! I was ... less right ! We should stick to what we' re good at ... being bad . Minion ? You there ! Yeah , you . Bring out the Black Mamba .\par
OK , Titan . It' s time to go down in style . I hear there' s a new hero who dares challenge my evil . Where is the one they call Titan ? Challenge me if you dare ! Oh no . We' re gonna crash ! This is embarrassing . Of all the inconsiderate , bone- headed ... ... irresponsible , rude ... Unprofessional , that' s what this is !\par
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting ? Of course not ! Hey , Megamind ! You' re actually the guy I want to see . Also , there' s a door here . Do you have any idea how long I waited for you ? No , no , no , I totally understand what you' re saying . Could you just , just shut up for one second . I' m trying to beat this level . Were you even planning on showing up ?\par
What' s this ? Where did you get all this stuff ? It doesn' t belong to me . - You stole it ? - Pretty cool , right ? - No , no , no , no ! You' re a hero ! - Being a hero is for losers ! It' s work , work , work , 24/ 7 , and for what ? I only took the gig to get the girl , and it turns out Roxanne doesn' t want anything to do with me .\par
- Roxanne Ritchi ? - Yeah ! Roxanne Ritchi ! I saw her having dinner and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb ! Who needs all that noise ? That' s why I think we should team up . You ... Wait ... What ? With my power , and your big- headedness ,\par
- we could rule the city ! - You want to team up ? I even drew up some new costume designs , see ? - Costume designs ? - You' d be the brains , so you' d get a little brain , wearing glasses on your costume , or something . And since I' m the cool one , I' d have , like , two tanks sword fighting ... I can' t believe you . All your gifts , all your powers , and you ... you squander them for your own personal gain . - Yes ! - No !\par
I' m the villain ! You' re the good guy ! I do something bad , and you come and get me ! That' s why I created you . Yeah , right . You' re nuts . Space Dad told me ... Look , I' m your space dad ! You should be more like Metro Man . - You tricked me ?\par
- Oh , don' t like that ? Well , there' s more . I' m also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne . - No . - And we were smooching up a storm ! When I get my hands on you , I' m gonna ... Yes ! Yes , I know ! Bring me to justice . Oh God , how I' ve missed this .\par
And the hero strikes the first blow . But evil returns with a backhand ! Yes ! Come out , you little freak ! I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement ! You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book ! You little blue twerp ! En garde ! Oh , now that' s the spirit ! Parry !\par
Thrust ! Parry again ! Now it' s time for some witty back and forth banter ! You go first ! Look , I' m not sure where to go with that ! This one' s for stealing my girlfriend ! This one' s for Space Dad making a fool out of me ! And , Megamind , this one' s for Space Stepmom ! Well done . I thought that battle went really , really well .\par
- I mean , I have a few notes . - Notes ? But they can wait . You can take me to jail now . Oh , no , no , no . I was thinking more like the morgue . You' re dead ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . This isn' t how you play the game . Game over .\par
Brain- bots ! I' m calling time out ! Time out ? Time out ! Brain- bots , initiate the fail- safe . Guess what , Buster Brown ? It' s made from copper . You' re powerless against it . It' s the very same metal used to defeat ... Metro Man ?\par
You should stop comparing me to Metro Man ! You can run , Megamind , but you can' t hide ! We' re saved ! We' re saved ! What' s your name , new hero ? - It' s Titan . - Thank you ! Thank you ! Titan has freed us ! Oh , I wouldn' t say " free . "\par
More like under new management . - What do you want ? - Titan' s turned evil . Congratulations . Another one of your genius plans has backfired on you . And why did my doorman let you up ? Carlos . Please , Roxanne , no . No . I need your help .\par
Why do you need my help ? Because you' re the smartest person I know . But you can' t hide here . The copper should have worked . Why didn' t the copper work ? The copper worked perfectly well last time . Copper ? You' re not making any sense . Look , if we don' t find Titan' s weakness , he' il destroy the whole city . - OK , how can I help ?\par
- We need to find answers . You knew Metro Man best . Did he have a hideout ? A cave ? A solitary fortress of some kind ? Anything that would give us clues . Well ... there is one place I know . You gave him these powers . Can' t you just take them away ? I can' t .\par
I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car . The night you dumped me . Alone . In the rain . Did you ever look back ? - No ! - My giant blue head ! I guess we' re here . So , this is where he hid it . After all these years .\par
My old shoolhouse . You know , I think there' s an apology in order for the other night . OK , that would be nice , but make it quick . We have much more pressing matters to deal with . Wow . I can' t believe he kept all this stuff . I remember when he wore that . - Shouldn' t we try to stay focused here ? - Yes , of course . Right .\par
Focused . Come over and look at this . What is it ? What did you find ? Look . This glass has ice cubes in it . Yes , that' s what happens when water gets cold . No , what I' m saying is , don' t you think it' s a little odd that the ice hasn' t melted yet ? One of life' s great mysteries . Hey .\par
We now have confirmed reports . Titan , first thought to be this city' s new hero , has turned evil . The city has never seen this level of destruction . If only Metro Man were still alive . - You' re alive ? - You' re alive . - I' m alive . - But I , we ... We saw your skeleton ! You were dead !\par
Are you a ghost ? There had better be an amazing explanation for this . Speak , apparition . OK . OK , OK , OK . You both deserve the truth . It all started back at the observatory . Roxanne was kidnapped . I was gonna stop you . My head wasn' t in the game that day .\par
We were kind of going through the motions . So ... using my super- speed , I decided to go clear my head . Fire ! Then I realized , we had done this same silly charade our entire lives . I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling , but I just felt stuck . I began to realize , despite all my powers , each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn' t : a choice . Ever since I can remember , I' ve always had to be what the city wanted me to be . But what about what I wanted to do ? Then it suddenly hit me .\par
I do have a choice . I can be whatever I want to be . No one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig . You can' t just quit , either . That' s when I got the brilliant idea ... to fake my death . Copper drains my powers . Your weakness is copper ? Once your death ray hit , I' d never felt so alive . So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school . Metro Man was finally dead .\par
And Music Man was born ! - Music Man ? - That way I could keep my logo . - ' Cause of wha ... ? - Come again ? I was finally free to get in touch with my true power ... ... weaving lyrical magic . Check this out . I have eyes that can see Right through lead ... - You' re horrible !\par
- Granted , you have talent . But there' s a madman out there destroying our ... your city . How could you do this ? ! The people of this city relied on you , and you deserted them ! You left us in the hands of him ! - No offense . - No , I' m with you . Look , we need your help . I' m sorry . I really am .\par
I' m done . You know , little buddy , there' s a ying for every yang . If there' s bad , good will rise up against it . It' s taken me a long time to find my calling . Now it' s about time you find yours . Hey , who needs him ? We can beat Titan ourselves . I say we go back to the evil lair , grab some ray guns , hold him sideways , and just go all gangsta on him . We can' t . So that' s it ?\par
You' re just giving up ? I' m the bad guy . I don' t save the day , I don' t fly off into the sunset , and I don' t get the girl . I' m going home . Unless someone comes to our aid soon , all may be lost . Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus . Remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice . Authorities have issued a warning to stay out of the downtown area at all costs . Hal ! Hal !\par
Let me guess . After seeing how awesome I am , you' ve finally come to your senses ? Well , I' m over you . - I' ve come to stop you , Hal . - You ? Oh , wow . OK , what are you gonna do , report me to death ? I was going to try reasoning with you . You and I , we worked together for a long time . I know you .\par
You don' t know me . You never took the time to know me . This is the first time we' ve hung out socially , and it' s when I' m about to destroy the city ! I want to talk to the real Hal . I want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman , and eating dip , and being a nerd , and being not as scary as the Tighten Hal . Too late ! Megamind ! You and I have some unfinished business . I' il be waiting at Metro Tower . Oh , and just so you don' t get cold feet ...\par
Roxanne . Come on , Roxie , call for your hero to come rescue you . Megamind , I don' t even know if you' re listening , but if you are , you can' t give up . The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight , even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning . It was your best quality . You need to be that guy right now . The city needs you . I need you . Roxanne . You have one hour .\par
Don' t keep me waiting . Warden ! Warden ! Listen to me ! You have to let me go ! Tighten has to be stopped ! Sorry , Megamind . You still have 88 life sentences to go . Plenty of time to reflect on what you' ve done . Did you want to hear me say it ?\par
I' il say it . Here it is , from the blackest part of my heart . I am sorry ! Not buying it . I don' t blame you . I' ve terrorized this city countless times . Created a hero who' s turned out to be a villain . I lied to Roxanne , and ... ... my best friend Minion , I treated like dirt . Please don' t make this city ... ... don' t make Roxanne pay for my wrongdoings . Apology accepted .\par
Oh , Minion , you fantastic fish , you . What are we waiting for ? We' d better get going . You got me . - Good luck , fellas ! - We' re gonna die ! Wait , what ? Hey , Metro losers . This is Metro Tower . They say it' s supposed to be a symbol of our city' s strength .\par
But for me , it' s a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart . And I hate reminders ! Help ! Please don' t do this . I know there' s still good in you , Hal . You' re so naive , Roxie . You see the good in everybody , even when it' s not there . You' re living a fantasy . There is no Easter Bunny , there is no Tooth Fairy , and there is no Queen of England . This is the real world , and you need to wake up !\par
You dare challenge Megamind ? This town isn' t big enough for two super- villains ! Oh , you' re a villain all right ! Just not a super one ! Yeah ? What' s the difference ? Presentation ! - I knew you' d come back . - Well , that made one of us . - What' s the plan ?\par
- Well , it mostly involves not dying . I like that plan . Building ! Go faster ! Make this thing go faster ! I can' t control it ! No . Well , that was easy . Looks like there' s only one loose end now . Please , let' s have a little respect for public transportation .\par
You came back ! You were right , Roxanne . I never should have left . I ... I thought you were dead . My death was ... greatly exaggerated . So , you' re the punk I' ve heard about . I' m sorry . I did the best I could . I' m so proud of you .\par
Minion ? Surprise ! He' s the real hero . Megamind . Going somewhere ? Besides jail ? No , not in the face , man . Please . If you know what' s good for you , Tighten , you' il stay out of Metrocity ! - You got it !\par
- For good ! Pretty sneaky , sis . But there' s only one person I know who calls this town " Metrocity . " You . Bet you think it' s really funny ? Let' s all laugh at the really cool guy ? Well , you' re not gonna be laughing for long . The invisible car . Hey ! Remember that night that I dumped you ?\par
You' re bringing this up now ? Well , I did look back ! You did ? You did ? Yes ! And you should look back right now ! Oh , I get it ! This is the last time you make a fool out of me ! I made you a hero . You did the fool thing all by yourself .\par
You' re so pathetic . No matter what side you' re on , you' re always the loser . There' s a benefit to losing . You get to learn from your mistakes . Oh , you' ve got to be kidding me ! Minion , if I live , I will kill you . Enjoy your flight ! Megamind ! So this is how it ends . Normally , I' d chalk this up to my last glorious failure .\par
But not today . What can I say ? Old habits die hard . Say bye- bye , Roxie . Ollo . The thing about bad guys , they always lose ! - You did it . You won . I finally had a reason to win . You .\par
Minion ! Can' t see . It' s cold and ... warm , and dark and light . It' s me , Minion . I' m right here . We' ve had a lot of adventures together , you and I. We have , Minion . I mean ... most of them ended in horrible failure , but we won today . Didn' t we , sir ? Yes , Minion , we did it .\par
Thanks to you . Code : We' re The Good Guys Now . Code : I Guess We Are . Oh , oh , oh , I' m going ! I think this , this is it ! I' m going ... going far ... What a drama queen . You know , I' m feeling much better now .\par
I guess I just needed a swim . He had you , didn' t he ? Classic Minion . Don' t give me that face . He reels you in with that little face . - Look at that face . - We did it ! We did it ! - Fist pump ! - You did it !\par
We won , we won , we won ! Get back , you savages ! Sorry ! Sorry . He' s just not used to positive feedback . Funny , I guess destiny is not the path given to us ... ... but the path we choose for ourselves . All right , put your hands in the air . Now hand over your wallets . I' m just kidding !\par
Just kidding ! I have to admit , being good has its perks . You know , you look pretty good in white . Megamind , if you plea ... Hey . My kid can' t see . Sorry , my friend . Way to go , little buddy . I knew he had it in him . Ladies and gentlemen ,\par
Megamind , defender of Metro City ! You know , I like the sound of that . Hit it ! I' m bad ! I' m bad ! Sir , you really need to empty your pockets more often . This has been the worst day of my entire life . No worries . I can' t believe that I didn' t get a pedicure for this . How embarrassing .\par
Look at that . If I were with a real guy doing this I would have gotten a pedicure , and a wax . Oh shit , that one\'e2\'80\'99 s worse ! - Sorry I didn' t get a pedicure . - What ? Uh , my toes . I am Sorry . I' m not looking at your toes , - I' m looking at your cervix . - Right .\par
Now I kind of wish you were looking at my toes . - All done . - That' s it ? We' il , uh , elevate your legs for 10 minutes and you' il be good to go . This is the first I hear the ticking clock sound and I' m not freaking out . Good . Just relax . I can' t , I' m totally freaking out ! Oh , come on , everything is going to be great . I have a feeling that you and , um , CRM- 1014 are going to make beautiful babies together .\par
Thank you . Oh God , I hope this works . I wanted this for so long . Maybe this isn' t how I pictured it ... exactly , thought I would have a little more support . No , you don' t want kids ! Trust me . Well that\'e2\'80\'99 s easy for you to say , you have four . And it' s awful . They' ve ruined my life ! What ? !\par
No , go away ! Have you seen my vagina ? I mean have you ? But I wouldn' t show it to you , I will show it to you just to prove you do not want to have kids . I will show you , my vagina ! I don' t want to see that , I want to have a baby . I just think you' re tired of being alone , you haven' t met the right guy ... It' s not about a guy , this isn' t about a guy I' ve dated hundreds of guys over the past five years not one of them is close to being the one . It' s just not happening for me .\par
Yeah , but that does not mean that it won' t . - Doesn' t mean that it will . - Is that my chicken ? ! What are you doing ? ! That is your dinner , not a toy ! I hate them . Do you smell pee ? So I had to figure it out on my own . I examined every possibility and arrived at the most logical conclusion . Would you be my baby daddy ?\par
What ? ! No , I can' t be the father , Are you out of your mind ? ! What are you talking ... No , no ! I' m in my sexual prime , alright ! I have countless more women to bed before I do something idiotic as having a baby . Clyde , you' re my friend . Don' t you want to help me ? I mean , we don' t have to have sex . You don' t have to be involved at all .\par
Alright ? Just ... give me your sperm . Oh , oh . Ok . Ok . You' re ... you' re feeling lonely , alright ? Maybe a little ... a little dead down there . I get it , I get it . Long time since you had uh ... you know ... - J .. Just shut up !\par
Ok ! Just forget it ! Forget the whole thing . - What ? Well that was a bust . So I took life by the , uh ... horns ? and I ... I did what I had to do . Yeah . It' s going to be ok . I have a plan .\par
- Whoa , You don' t have to walk like that ! - Well , oh ... ok . Uh , by the way , I know a excellent support group for single moms , if you' re interested . Great ! Great . Maybe we should hug ? We might have just made a baby together . - Good luck . - Okay . Alright .\par
- Hi . - Hi . - Hi ! - Get away from me ! Taxi ! Excuse me , this is my cab . - What , you own it ? - No , but I' m about to rent it . If you see someone hail a cab and a cab pulls up you can' t just jump in the cab and say it yours ? - I didn' t see you .\par
- I saw you see me . Sir ? sir ... excuse me Who saw you first ? Look , maybe you' re not from around here but there is a code , you know there are certain rules we try to follow ... Fine ! Forget it , I get out ! But not because your right but because I am in a terrific mood and you' re ruining it . No , I' il get out . - Now what ? - I don' t know , you tell me ?\par
- Hey , hey , hey ! - Where' s it going ? Come back ! Well , that was stupid ! Why did you get out ? ! You stupid head ! You said you were in a good mood and I was ruining it . I felt bad . I' m sorry , did you tell me a stupid head ? How is your great mood now ?\par
Please stop talking to me . So why you such a good mood anyways ? Not that it\'e2\'80\'99 s your business but good things are happening to me . That' s great , I hope it continues . Thanks Well , have a nice life and try not to steal any more cabs . Yeah , you do the same . Hey , there' s a penny right there . Why don' t you pick it up , its good luck . Only if it' s heads .\par
Now somebody else can have good luck . - Bye . - Bye . Thank you for coming to Hudson Mutts . - Hi Nutzy - Oh my God . You' re glowing . - Oh my God , she' s glowing , right ? - Uh , huh . - Tell us everything . - There' s not much to tell .\par
No , no , no ... you just got shot up with a wad of red headed , freckle sperm . There' s something to tell . Wait , he had red hair and freckles , why' d you do that ? - I tried to talk her out of it . - Red pubes ... ew ! I never saw his pubes , it was a vial of semen . So come on , what happened ? I laid down , put my feet up over my head and five minutes later it was over . I barely felt a thing . Basically it was like having sex with Clyde .\par
You wish . If you need me I' il be back with legs over my head . - Red hair and freckles ! - You had your chance ! What ? I do not know , it\'e2\'80\'99 s just weird , you know who was this guys she was with anyways ? - She wasn' t actually with him . - Yeah , but I still want to kick his ass . - Is that wrong ? - You' re stupid .\par
Ok , alright . Welcome to Single Mothers and Proud . As the name suggests we are all single ... mothers and , uh , proud . Some of us have adopted some of us have conceived with a donor , every stories is different , but with the same common denominator wanted a child and we made it happen on our own . We sure did , we sure did . Are you already a single mother or you trying to become one ? I was just inseminated a few days ago . Inseminated , makes me feel like a cow or something . Well , we do what we have to do when we don' t have a penis partner . So , let\'e2\'80\'99 s hear about you .\par
Oh , ok . Let' s see ... I own a pet store . Yeah , I use to work in the corporate world . Which was great for a while but just didn' t feel like the life I wanted to live . So , now I am happy on the work front but , you know , I don' t know even though I have more balance , personal ... I still haven' t found the one . Well , the elusive one . Good luck . If I had a dollar for every time I hear that .\par
I thought I' d be married with kids by now but that\'e2\'80\'99 s just not happening so , I guess it\'e2\'80\'99 s time for my backup plan . Well , Zoe listen , if you really want a baby we here at Single Mothers and Proud ... ah ha ... We can be your partners . From inception to graduation , everything in between We can be here for you . Great . Dakota was born here , in this very room . Right where you are sitting actually . Really ? Right here ?\par
Imagine that . So how old is your baby , now ? I' m three . So cute . Why do you need a support group ? - You' re not very supportive . - What ? You just told me that if I breast feed , my girls are going to end up looking like empty tube socks . Hey , I' m just being honest . Don' t even get me started on what child birth does to your bladder .\par
What does it do to your bladder ? Oh , I just peed a little bit . I don' t think I' m pregnant anyways . The doctor said it would take a few tries . Something about frozen sperm being lazy . Oh , come with me for a minute I have to make some muffins for some bullshit teacher' s appreciation day . You' re going to make muffins ? Oh hell no . There is a place here that sells them ,\par
I pick out the worse ones and I pretend that I made them . Come on . Okay . Which is the ugliest ? It seems too much trouble over something so trivial . Welcome to motherhood . There' s that guy ? What guy ? The one selling cheese I know him . He' s hot .\par
He sells cheese ? You sell hamsters . Can I help you ladies ? No , we' re good , thank you . Like what you see ? What ? Just talking about the muffins . - Hey you . - Hey . Hi What .. what a nice surprise !\par
How did you know I worked here ? I didn' t . Oh , ok . Did you follow me here ? Follow you ? To the farmers market , are you kidding me ? We ... we came to buy muffins . You where here , tell him . Well , you better buy something , because you ate all my samples . It' s really nice to see you , I never got your name .\par
- I' m Stan . - Oh , Zoe . I' m Mona . So how do you two not know each other ? - He stole my cab . - She stole my cab . Oh , ok . We should go . We should ? Yeah , we have that important thing .\par
Well , can your important thing wait for a few minutes ? I' il give you a taste of my cheese . I can rephrase that . Ok , this is our basic chevre . Probably our best seller , or the cheese that started it all as they say . These are our surface ripen cheeses , these are fantastic . And these are the aged raw milk cheeses . Now ... This is really boring , isn' t it ? - Uh , Yes .\par
- Um , No . This is Louie , he works for me . - Hi - Hi , Zoe Can I get you a sample box ? Um , I' m ok . You' re not lactose intolerant are you ? I hate that . Hey , you' re still coming over tonight right ? I ... um , yeah , yeah . We should go .\par
- Ready ? - I want a sample box . Ok , well I got to go . Bye . Uh , bye . Bye . - You said free sample box , right ? - Yes . Ok , spill it . Who is he , what does he do , how do we know him ?\par
Who ? Stan , from the farmers market . He' s called twice already . I' m going to kill Mona . Is he a farmer ? He makes cheese . He' s a pilgrim ? Oh , Mona called too , she says his feta was incredible . That makes so much more sense now . Who is this guy ?\par
He' s nobody , he' s just some guy . Are you blushing ? She' s blushing right ? - You' re totally blushing . - She' s blushing . Can we just calm down and get ready for the book signing ? No , this is exciting . I' m not calming down . Look , he' s nobody , and even if he was somebody , it doesn' t matter cut , I don' t want to be with anybody . Okay ?\par
So let\'e2\'80\'99 s just get back to work . - Finding a relationship is work ... - I do not want a relationship . Well , it is . So dogs have a ingrain pack mentality . If we don' t assert leadership over our dogs our dogs are going to show unstable behaviour or dominate behaviour . In other words , in the dog world , who you are is stable or unstable energy . A leader or a follower . So , when a dog introduces himself to another dog , What do they do ?\par
Exactly . When a human wants meet a dog ... Oh my God ! He' s so ... So , I mean , it\'e2\'80\'99 s like poor dog .. And so they' re interacting based on energy and also the nose ... Ok , now this is getting weird . I know we keep running into each other , it' s crazy . Oh , so your being here , is just another coincidence ? Oh no , I love this guy .\par
- Don' t you have some place to be tonight ? - Not ' til later . - Do you even have a dog ? - No . But I might get one now that I can be the pack leader . I' m really busy here . Ok so , you have a boyfriend or something . Just tell me , I can take it . Or you' re just no , you' re not interested in me ? You' re making a big mistake , I am very interesting .\par
I' m just not interested in men right now . Oh , you ... you' re gay ? I' m not gay ! Hey you two , would you please take it outside ? - Sorry . - Ok , sorry , sorry about that . This is not a good time for me , ok . I' m going through some changes . Menopause ? Menopause ?\par
Seriously ? How old do think I am ? Ok , you know , let\'e2\'80\'99 s start over , because the more I think about it , we' d never make it as a couple anyway . You' re way too sceptical , We should be friends . I have enough friends . You can never have too many friends . What are you doing tonight ? Getting take out and going home to bed . Clearly you don' t have that many friends . Ok , here' s my proposition and don' t freak out because it require very little commitment .\par
I' m getting take out too , let' s walk together towards the same place , order and pay for our own respective meals and we' il say goodbye . Where do you want to go ? Thank you . No fair , you chose this place because it takes two seconds . No , I chose it because it' s the best . Alright , well I want to see you take a bite of that . I don' t believe you' il eat it . Fine . There , happy now ?\par
You have no idea how good this is . I cannot believe you lived New York your whole life and you' ve never gone to Gray' s Papaya . What' s wrong with you ? Actually I haven' t lived here all my life . We moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm . No , not die , they actually ... they bought a farm and we moved upstate . They retired to Phoenix five years ago , and I run the place now . What about your family ? Actually my parents died when I was young . It' s just me and my grandmother now .\par
I' m sorry , I' m so sorry . It' s ok , it was long time ago . I really have to go . Alright , but I cannot let you walk home alone because ... this is very dangerous neighbourhood . What school did you go to ? Well , I kind of dropped out . I met this Swedish girl during my semester abroad ... Let me guess , you fell in love and got married . - And started an inn in Vermont . - Of course .\par
It lasted like three seconds , I didn' t know how to run an inn and she didn' t know how not to sleep the everyone that worked there , so ... - Ouch - we got divorced , yeah ... She took everything . I had to move back in with my parents . Work myself out of debt , and tried to figure out how not to blame every women on the planet for honest Harish ways . How' s that going ? Not so good . Ok , I want to know everything . First kiss ?\par
Some jerk with a dirt bike and chapped lips . You ? 7th grade , she wore braces and head gear - It was terrifying . - Ouch Hey , look . - Here' s one for you . - That' s weird . Ok , best kiss ? Um , that' s a tough one .\par
Because , if we weren' t just friends . I' d kiss you right now , and I' d be your best kiss . How do you know ? I know . Someone looking for you ? Yeah , I have to go . - Okay . - Okay . - Bye . - Bye .\par
I' il call you . You think it was the muffin girl ? I guess ... I don' t know . Why do I even care ? You like him ! Ow ! What if I' m pregnant ? Then it' il work out perfectly . - What do you mean ?\par
- Because , if you really like him , as soon as that happens you' il break up with him because you' re pregnant and you wouldn' t have to put yourself out there , possibly get hurt . Hey , that' s your dream . Ah , besides ... I' m not pregnant . And I' m ok on my own . You' re going to see him again ? Yeah , I think so . It' s not going to happen Nutzy . Hello . Oh , Stan .\par
Go away . Stop it . You' re making me nervous . You' re early . I' il be a minute , okay ? Uh , 3 to 5 minutes actually . You want a beer ? Uh , yeah , yeah , sure . You want one ? - I' il let you know .\par
- Okay . Oh my God . Is he ok ? He' s fine . Happens all the time . I' m sorry . Can you give me a minute ? - Yeah , yeah . - Ok , good . Damn it Nuts .\par
Give me that . Give it to me . Let go . Now ! Zoe , everything okay ? Yeah ! You know , just showing him who' s the pack leader . You idiot ! You better not swallow that thing . Give it to me .\par
Nutzy , open . Open . - You look really pretty tonight . - Thank you . You always look really pretty but tonight you look , uh , especially pretty . And that dress is , uh , ... is really something . - Thank you . - You' re welcome . Did you buy a new dress for our date tonight ? - Don' t flatter yourself .\par
- I' il take that as a yes . I guess you' il never know . I guess not . - Except you left the price tag on . - What ? Allow me . I got it . You know , I had this dress for a long time , it' s just I haven' t worn it yet . It' s why the tag still on . You' re not that special .\par
Really ? Look at this place . I don' t know what to say . Finally . What' s that suppose to mean ? ! It just means good . Don' t say anything . You don' t have to say anything . You know , just come over here , sit down . You think I talk too much ?\par
- I did not say that . - So what' d you say ? It' s just you' re very quick , you always have an response for things . Which I like , but tonight , just you know , just be surprised . Surprise . You' re good . - So you work for an internet company ? - Uh huh . - I don' t see that at all . - Oh , I was a very important person .\par
You would have been very impressed . - Really ? - Uh huh . How did you get the pet store ? Actually it was due to my dog , Nuts . I bought him at this fancy dog store near my house . Cutest puppy you' ve ever seen . 6 months later he almost dies . Turns out he was from one of those puppy mills , where the dogs are so in bred , he was falling apart . What did you do ?\par
Did you sue them ? I thought about it , but then I thought what good would that do , they' il still sell in bred dogs , So I quit my job , and I took the stock option money over to the pet store , and I bought it . I know how to milk a goat Does that do anything for you ? No , not really . Can I ask you a serious question Zoe ? What ? Did you buy that dress to wear for me tonight ? I will never tell . Really ?\par
Because , uh ... I have ways of making you talk . Let me get that , let me get that . Oh ! Hose ... hose over there behind the fence . You see it ? Got the hose ? Ok , this is war . You weren' t even pointing at the fire , you were pointing at my face . I wasn' t even trying to soak you , I swear .\par
Whatever , I looked into your eyes and saw you had this crazy look , like a crazy person Not true . It is true and ... you know what else , I think I owe you another dress . And I definitely own you another date . Well , I' d like that . Why don' t you come to the farm with me next weekend ? I' il call you . I' il wait by the phone . What ? Holly shit !\par
I know . Are you sure ? If I' m not then my dog is . You' re not making any sense . So you' re definitely pregnant ? Congratulations How we feeling ? - We' re freaking out ! - What she said . Why ? We preformed an intrauterine insemination using sperm that you purchased .\par
This isn' t exactly what we call an accident . It' s just happening so fast . Keep breathing . Pump those arms . What did you all eat last night ? - Hey Arthur . - Well , hello my dear . Oh no , no , don' t get up . It' s ok . I can' t get up .\par
- Came to see my lovely fianc\'c3\'a9e ? - Yes . Oh , she' s looking fine today , let me tell you , just fine . - Hi sweetheart . - Hey . - I need to talk to you . - Sure . Alone . Surely ! Don' t worry about them , they can' t hear anything anyways .\par
I am pregnant . - What ? - I' m pregnant . - How what ? - I' m pregnant . I cannot hear you darling . Oh Jesus , Judy , she' s pregnant ! Turn up your hearing aid . I' m confused ... you said that this was what you wanted . But this guy , he' s special .\par
Now the whole thing is going to fall apart . What makes him so special ? I do not know , he' s very ... real , and funny . And different . I like him Nana . What should I do ? Zoe , you always get ahead of yourself . You barely know him . Spend some time with him , see what he' s really like . He could be a total douche bag and then the whole thing is moot .\par
- Maybe he is a douche bag . - Oh come on . You really think he would ask you away for the weekend if he had a girlfriend ? There' s no way he' s dating that muffin bitch , Zoe . Trust me . Who can say ? Maybe he' s looking to get laid ? Well , don' t have sex with him , ok ? You can' t - because that would really complicate things .\par
- I know . Oh , it\'e2\'80\'99 s going to be hard though with three times the blood coursing through your body . Excuse me ? Oh , yeah . That' s why pregnant women are so Horney all the time . Is that what it is ? I thought it was me . No , when I was pregnant my body was so sensitive I could have an orgasm sitting on a bus . I think I' m going to get sick .\par
- Me too . - What ? It' s a happy story . Alright , I' m just going to go up there and tell him that I' m pregnant - just lower my cards on the table . - Ok , good . Just don' t lay on the table . Ok , because you cannot have sex . Don' t look at me like that . I know , this is a big mess we' re in .\par
I' m going to fix it . Shit , here it is . Watch out for that tree . Yeah , thanks . - Hi . - Hi . The tree should not have been there , that' s all I' m going to say . Whatever Mrs. Magoo . - Oh , ok . - Come on now , I am glad you' re here .\par
Me too . Stan , there' s something I need to tell you . I am pregnant . Yes , pregnant . I' m going to have a baby . I' m with child . Shit . Stan ... Stan ... Stan ...\par
I' ve been inseminated . Yes , inseminated . I' m going to have a baby ! Uh , would you like a plate ? Um , a napkin ? trough ? These are for you . - That' s sweet , thank you . - You' re welcome . You' re good . It' s just that stew is so delicious .\par
I knew you liked it . So , what' s the next step for a cheese farmer ? Very funny . I want to start a sustainable Gourmet Shop , okay . Cheese , wine , bread , prepared foods . But everything local , nothing from farther than 30 miles . All based on the farmers markets . - That' s a good idea . - Thank you very much . I' m good at ideas , I' m just not good with follow through .\par
I wasn' t good at marriage , I wasn' t good at running a bed and breakfast , thank God we didn' t have kids . You don' t want kids ? I don' t think so . Well , I don' t know . For years I' ve never thought about the future , just kind of lived in the moment . But maybe I' m different now . I really want to take the next step , I want to move on with my life . - About the future ...\par
- Uh huh . - Let' s talk about that . - Ok . Because the future is now . - Right ? - Right . There' s something I need to tell you . Hold that thought . Come here . - I want to show you something .\par
- What is it ? - It' s cheese . - I can see that . No , no , no , it' s new . I had this idea to use these two different types of goat' s milk to come up with something really unique . It' s sweet and sassy and complex . I was inspired . So what are you saying ? I' m your cheese muse ? Yeah .\par
You' re kind of hard to read right now . Well , I really want to kiss you , but it smells like cheese in here . We have to ... take it slow , Okay ? - We can' t have sex . - Fine . Ok ... Ok ... Ok ... Ok ... Did you just ...\par
Holly shit ! Is my nose bleeding ? You punched me . - Sorry . - It' s ok . It was amazing . It was like over the top amazing . What was that , like a 3 or 4 for you ? Stan ... Stan ...\par
There' s something I have to tell you . Ok , what is it ? Why are you crying ? I' m pregnant . I' m pretty sure it doesn' t happen that fast . I know it ... it' s hard to explain . What are you talking about ? I' m pregnant . Who' s the father ? I don' t know\par
I mean , I know who it is , I just don' t know his name exactly . It' s a donor of a sperm bank . Seriously , what the hell are you talking about ? When did all this happened ? Actually , it was the day we met . Yeah , I didn' t think to tell you because I didn' t think there was any way that I could be pregnant so fast . But why ? Because I wanted a baby . And I never met the right guy and I thought that if I waited any longer , I might miss my chance .\par
Alright , we just make love and you' re telling me that your pregnant with some stranger' s child . Don' t say it like that . You make it sound dirty . I wanted a baby and I thought I had to do it alone . It was before I met you . I don' t know what to say . What am I supposed to say ? Congratulations , this is terrific news ? I made this big decision , this ... this thing and then I met you . I' m sorry .\par
About what ? Getting pregnant or lying to me about it ? - I didn' t lie . - You didn' t tell the truth . Where are you going ? I thought this would be easier . To just disappear at the crack of dawn ? Don' t I get a say ? You said everything there was to say last night . No , I didn' t .\par
Oh , you left out the part that you had a girlfriend , that was pretty convenient . I don' t have a girlfriend . That girl from the farmers market ? She' s not my girlfriend . She was , but was a few years ago . Olivia is in my class , we study together . Study what ? I' m a student . I' m still in school , I go at night . Why didn' t you want to tell me ?\par
Because it' s embarrassing . You' re this incredibly accomplished person , and I didn' t even finish college ? I mean , I have this great life but ... barely passing economics , you know . Where are you going ? Look , let\'e2\'80\'99 s not drag this out , ok ? I lied to you , you lied to me . We both have other plans , and being together is just messing everything up . We should just go our separate ways . Goodbye . So how did you two meet ?\par
- We can , uh , talk later in your office . - Ok . Well , everything seems right on track . A little blood , quite normal . Stan , you have to stay here if you don' t want . I' m fine , I' m good . Now , I' m going to do an ultrasound . This is how we view the future Oh , I see , you rub it on her stomach . For a minute I thought you' re going to put that huge thing ...\par
In her vagina ? It is too early to go through the abdomen , you see . We have to go through the vagina . Vagina . Vagina . Vagina . Vagina . Vagina . Maybe if I say enough you' il feel a little more comfortable . - Vagina .\par
- It' s not working . Ok now Zoe , with a little bit of luck , we' il see a heartbeat . That' s it ? That little thing ? Is everything okay ? Oh , everything is ... - What , what ? - I see another heartbeat . It has two hearts ? No , but you have two babies .\par
Are you going to leaving now ? Because this is more than you bargained for . It' s more than I bargained for . But , just tell me , ok , so ... I can be prepared . I just ... need to sit here . You know ? - Okay . - Okay . But then are you going to leave ?\par
Ok , one kid is a lot , two kids is a posse . I' m just getting use to us as a couple . And now all of a sudden you' re having a posse ? Are you ready for a posse ? I don' t even know if I like kids . Hey ! Beat it pal ! I don' t want to cause a scene , but get your hands out of your pockets and get the hell out of here . No , I' m talking to you because you' re the only pervert with his hands in his pockets at a playground . - Hey , if you don' t have kids , get lost !\par
I have kids , Ok ? A week ago I didn' t even know she was pregnant and now she' s having twins ! I just saw the ultrasound . The one that goes inside . I know what you need . How did this happen ? - Take that off - This it ? - Yup - Oh man , I' m dizzy . I' m sweating and dizzy . - That' s normal , bro .\par
- Is it ? - Which one' s yours ? - I' ve got three . - Three ? - Yeah . There is Charlie right there , and that' s Roxy . You see the little fella over there ? That' s Matt - He' s eating sand - Yeah By the time you get to the third one , you don' t worry so much about that stuff .\par
What' s it like , the whole kid thing ? It' s great ! Except for the lack of sleep , free time ... sex with my wife , butt naked Friday' s in the family room ... That' s not the answer I was looking for . its fine . The best way I can describe it is ... ... It' s awful , awful , awful , awful and then something incredible happens And then awful , awful , awful , awful , awful And something incredible happens again It' s like this all day , every day I feel like I' m drowning\par
like I' m gasping to get my old life back and then a small moment happens ... ... that\'e2\'80\'99 s so magical So life affirming that it makes it all worthwhile . This will be best thing you ever do . Dada . Hey , son I guess this would be that moment right ? Yup , this would be it . - Hey , what do you have there , son ? - Poo poo Well , almost .\par
- Son , is that cat shit ? - No - That' s your shit ? - No This isn\'e2\'80\'99 t even his shit . Charlie , Roxy , meet me at the bathroom ! What I tell you about playing with other people shit ? So , why are you upset ? It' s so lucky . To get pregnant on the first try with frozen sperm is rare but to get pregnant with twins ... ?\par
Come on , that' s unheard of . Ok , when you want to speak you can . Does anyone else have anything in the mean time that they like to share ? - Tabitha ? - Yeah , I' m having a hard time Luka keeps asking me why his friends have two parents and he only has one . I guess I knew this would happen someday - But I just wasn' t prepared ... - Ok , there' s this guy , his name is Stan - and he' s fantastic - Wasn' t I just speaking ?\par
You know , whenever you meet somebody , the kind of guy who makes you rethink everything like ... maybe I can be a stay at home mom Maybe I can . I love being barefoot and pregnant Maybe he can teach me how to make cheese and we can live off the land Zoe , this group is called Single Mothers and Proud I know . I know . I know I' m sorry . I wasn' t planning to meet anybody .\par
It just ... it just happened And now I' ve thrown all my plans out the window and really ... fallen for this guy . I' m just afraid he might not stay . What should I do ? I don' t know This is wildly outside my field of expertise Yeah , because we are a ... single mothers group . So don' t tend to give advice on how to get your boyfriend to commit Not usually . Maybe you should join a different group .\par
Ok , we are going to have to take a vote on this Zoe , because ... I think we all collectively feel you are in a very wildly different place than where we are - So we are going to take a vote . - Ok Hi How did you find me ? I called the store . I said it was an emergency What is it ? You' re crazy\par
- I don' t expect you to stay - I don' t expect you to expect me to stay What if I want to stay ? Well then I would be surprised and happy . - I can' t promise anything . - Neither can I. Ok fine , give me the hot dog Perry and Hudson . Feel free to run every red light . You got it . - Here we go .\par
- Here we go . This sucks ! Nothing fits me ! Please let me wear sweats . Honey , you can' t wear sweats . This is important . - I' il get that . - Wait , let me suck it in . Do you have a jacket or something ? - Gotcha , I gotcha .\par

- Hi - Hi I ripped my dress and I didn' t want to go ... how about that ? - What is that thing ? - Oh , Mona gave it to me It is supposed to help me sleep - Hold on . - Ok . It has been two weeks now and all she ever wants to do is to sleep with that pillow The pillow is a bitch . It' s totally replacing you , right ?\par
Totally , completely . She drags it everywhere My wife , she drew eyes on hers . So when I went to make a move in the middle of the night the pillow is staring at me like ... uh uh bro ! I don' t think so . We used to have sex all time , every day ! Now I can' t touch her . I can pearly go near her . Dude ! she' s pregnant .\par
You can' t win , the one who wins is the pillow . - Screw that pillow , man ! - You might have to . I did once . We' re going to be fine . We' re going to get through this . Everything is going to be fine . In a year\'e2\'80\'99 s time this is just going to be a funny memory , right ? That\'e2\'80\'99 s right . Before you know it the kids will be in school and you long for the days when a pillow was your biggest problem\par
It must be hard when they first go off to school Little school shoes , little backpacks No , saying goodbye to the kid is easy Saying goodbye to 20 grand , now that' s hard What are you talking about ? 20 grand ? What' s 20 grand ? And you will have twins . Double whammy . That' s a whole lot of parmesan .\par

You' re suppose to get an outfit to bring the babies home in from the hospital Yeah , but how many babies are you having ?\par
Well , I just got two of everything Look ... baby village people How much money did you spend today ? Where are we going to put all this shit anyway ? Do not worry it , everything will be ok Yeah , I don' t see how that\'e2\'80\'99 s possible . You haven' t even had the babies and everything has changed You know what ? There' s the door , Stan . If you want to go , you can go\par
Stop ! I hate it when you do that I know , I' m sorry . Let me see . Sorry . Have you gotten through page 279 yet ? No , I stopped reading when you tore one of my pages and used it as a napkin Well , it says here that women in the third trimester experience hormonal mood swings and their partner just have to be extra understanding about it You coming on to me right now ? It' s kind of hard to tell .\par
- What ? - You have chicken in your hair - Just right there ? - I do ? Did I get it ? You know what , honey ? Just ... I' m sorry , but not tonight , ok ? - Sorry - It' s okay Hey babe , you want some breakfast ?\par
No , thank you . It' s still night time - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I' m good , I' m good . Do you know how much preschool is ? 20 grand . For circle time . What about college ? Actually , I think colleges run about 50 grand right now , but that\'e2\'80\'99 s right now . So figure in 18 years it' il be doubled that at least and ... well we have twins so double it again .\par
So what' s that ? like 200 grand a year ? We haven' t even bought books , or clothes or shit you know ? Probably going to need cars when they ' re at school You know I' m going to be a push over and buying whatever they want So what' s that ? Half a million a year ? I don' t have half a million a year . I' m in night school It' s just something I was thinking about . It' s no big deal\par
Why don' t you come back to bed , honey ? - Did I wake you up ? - No We' re going to be ok . I have money saved It' s not just about the money You know , I' il figure out a way to make enough money What is it then ? It' s just ... I need to know\par
Are you still in there ? I' m still here Excuse me , can I ... help you ? What do you think ? It' s a bit overwhelming huh ? There' re so many and are so ... big Well , they have to be big . Two babies right ? Yeah , but ... babies are small These are for giant mutant babies .\par

This is me in 7th grade This is me and nana at my confirmation This is the last picture I have of my mom I mean , she lived a few years more after this but ... We didn' t take any pictures because she didn' t want us to remember her that way I was 8 years old when she died\par
I can' t imagine She had this great laugh and really soft hands . She use to rub my back before I went to sleep Such a small thing but I think about it all the time Why don' t you ever talk about your dad ? She was in a coma for two years after this - He didn' t stick around - Oh , God , Zoe - I' m so sorry - It' s no big deal It was an important lesson for me . That' s when I realized that nothing lasts forever .\par
So now you know everything . Some things can last forever Maybe So about my exam ... I didn' t exactly ... That' s weird . I' m confused - Why' d you say you' d come in the first place ? - Seemed like a good idea at the time Is that Zoe ?\par

This is ... this is not about the money Or that you can' t afford kids You do not want this . That' s the problem He always told me he didn' t want kids Why are you still here ?\par
- That' s it isn' t it ? - Really ? After everything we' ve been through you think I don' t want kids ? - You really think that ? - That' s what you just said It' s not what I just said , it' s what you just heard . There is a big difference ! I don' t think you' re ready for this Now that it' s all happening , now that you seen a woman push a baby out Now ... it' s all too real for you\par
- And you' re scared - Damn right , I' m scared - Yeah . Aren' t you scared ? - You know what I' m scared of ? I' m scared that I' m going to have these babies and then you' re going to walk away You' re going to say , " They' re not mine " , and just going to walk away . Every day you\'e2\'80\'99 re looking for some kind of hint that I' m leaving no matter how many times I tell you that I' m not . I don' t know what else to do . What else am I supposed to do ?

You know , the way you just thrown caution into the wind and decided to go for it I want some of that too - What ? - Stan and I broke up - He said that babies weren' t his - He didn' t mean to say it - Tell her the whole story - He said it And if he said it , he thinks it , and if he thinks it , he feels it , And if he feels it what choice do I have ? Zoe , you know that' s not true . Your just looking for another way to back out\par
- Thank you - I' m not going to do this This man has chosen to be with you and raise your kids as his own You' re just going to throw it all away for some stupid word choice ? - Look at you - Look at you - I' m worried about you - No , don' t ... don' t worry I' m great . I' m great . I' m just emotional Come on , let me just finish your makeup Honey , you don' t always have to be so strong\par
You know , I know you learned it me but it' s no good - What does it get you ? - It means that I take care of myself - Just like you always did - No , Arthur takes care of me He' s been taking care of me for 22 years I just don' t want to admit it Zoe , stop pushing people away - I don' t want to talk this , ok ? - Listen to me , Zoe You' il never have a healthy relationship Stan or any other man if you don' t .\par

I wanted you at the wedding - What wedding ? - It was so beautiful and then it wasn' t ... it was people slipping everywhere Oh God , I hope nobody got hurt\par
Ok , you' re not making any sense But that' s just it , everything make sense All of a sudden everything is just so ... crystal clear . And the thing that' s the clearest is that I am so madly , deeply and completely in love with you . I can' t imagine spending another minute apart . Zoe , after all this time you come in here and expect ... I got to go to the hospital . I got to go to the hospital . Move it , move it . Get the lead out .\par

I' m just try to get her to see my point ! Sounds like yelling to me . What' s it going to take for you to believe that I' m here forever ? You had to see a stupid stroller ?\par
What about the fact I' ve been to every doctors appointment with you ? I picked out names with you I saved this from the very first day we met It' s the one that was tails up and you flipped it to heads I' ve kept it this whole time And it' s brought me the most incredible luck I can' t believe you kept that What about the fact that like it or not I' il be here holding your hand through this ? What about the fact that I' m going to be here when these babies are born ? Because I love their mommy\par
And what I want more than anything else in this world is to be their daddy But you have to promise me that from now on you' il believe me when I say I' m in And I' m not going anywhere Can you do that ?

Thank you all for coming This had been a dream me for a long time I need to thank one person for giving me the courage to do it - To Zoe - To Zoe ! From the moment you stole my cab From the day you dissede me at the farmers market I have been totally and completely under your spell I love you And you' ve made me the happiest man alive It was my cab\par
So , come over here for a minute - Givme that - What ? Since we do everything backwards and in hyper speed I was wondered if we could do what naturally follows having twins girls together Holly shit ! Will you marry me ? - Yes - Yeah ! - I can' t believe it - I know - Did we really just get engaged ? - Yes we did\par
Soon you will be my wife Stan ? Come on ! But you realize I know nothing about politics ? - You voted for him , didn' t you ? - Adam Lang ? Of course I did . Everyone voted for him . He wasn' t a politician , he was a craze . Well , there you go .\par
Look , it' s a new ghostwriter he needs , not another goddamn politico . He was paid $10 million for these memoirs , but rumor has it the manuscript' s a crock of shit . Rhinehart' s lending him his house at the ocean so they can fix it , and the pressure must have gotten to McAra . Pathologist said his blood was , like , three parts booze . You mean he drowned by accident ? Accident , suicide , who cares ? It was the book that killed him . Well , that' s encouraging . ( CHUCKLES DRYLY ) Who is this McAra ?\par
Should I have heard of him ? Yeah . He was some kind of aide to Lang when he was Prime Minister , so don' t admit that you haven' t . He was with him for years . I don' t know , Rick . This is a great opportunity for you . Plus the money is good . Kids won' t starve . - I don' t have any kids . Roy .\par
Who' re you expecting to bomb you , Random House ? We' re publishing Lang' s memoirs . That' s enough to make us a target , apparently . Thank you . - How many have you seen ? - Five . You' re the last . I must be honest . I don' t think you' re the right man for this assignment . Then it' s a good job it' s not your decision , Roy .\par
John Maddox , chief executive of Rhinehart , New York . Sir . Sidney Kroll , Mr. Lang' s Washington attorney . Mr. Kroll . And Nick Ricardelli I believe you know . All right , Rick . JOHN : All right , I gather from Rick you' re aware of the situation ? Perhaps you can enlighten us and tell us what exactly you' re gonna bring to this project . Nothing .\par
No , I' m not gonna pretend to be someone I' m not . You have my CV . His last effort was the autobiography of a magician , I Came , I Sawed , I Conquered . Yeah , and it went straight to number one , so ... After you turned it down , Roy . Look , I don' t read political memoirs . And I gather you' ve spent $10 million on this book . How much of that are you gonna see back ? Two ?\par
Three ? It' s bad news for your shareholders . And it' s worse news for your client , Mr. Kroll . Adam Lang , he wants a place in history , not in the remainder tables . Oh , please ! It' s because I know nothing about politics that I' il ask the questions that get right to the heart of who Adam Lang is . And that is what sells autobiographies . Heart . Wow ! That' s nicely done .\par
- What utter balls . - You think so ? John , of course . Adam Lang' s a world historical figure . His autobiography is gonna be a world- publishing event . Yeah , well , I got warehouses filled with world- publishing events waiting to be pulped . Sid ? Adam is obviously still very upset by what happened to Mike McAra . He was irreplaceable . Irreplaceable , and yet he has to be replaced .\par
Adam can certainly appreciate the benefits of trying someone different . In the end , it' s about chemistry . Do you work out , maybe ? - Not really . - That' s a pity . Adam likes to work out . Actually , I know a good writer on the Guardian who uses a gym . Okay , maybe we could just run over the publishing schedule , yeah ? We need to wrap this up in a month . - GHOST :\par
A month ? - Yes . - You want the book in a month ? - We already have a first draft . Yeah , well , it needs a lot of work . That' s why I like your resume here . You' re fast , and you deliver . You name it , he ghosts it . ( CHUCKLES ) And you' re a Brit .\par
The ghost should be a Brit . ( IMlTATES BRlTISH ACCENT ) To get the jolly old tone right , right ? ( CHUCKLlNG ) - Do you have any family commitments ? - No , I have no family . Why ? Adam is locked into a US lecture tour , also a fundraising program for the Adam Lang Foundation . It' s a month in the States . That' s okay . Couldn' t I bring the manuscript back here to work on ?\par
I' m afraid not . It' s in a secure environment in Marty Rhinehart' s own house . Only a few people are allowed to handle it . Sounds more like a bomb than a book . I will need to see it myself at some point . I am supposed to be editing it . Yeah , in theory . Actually , we need to talk about that . - JOHN : How soon can you get over there ?\par
- As soon as you want . - He' il fly tonight . - Rick . ( SOFTLY ) It' s okay . Okay , you' re in . Oh ! - ( GRUNTS ) Congratulations . - Thank you . Thanks . - Rick .\par
- Thank you . Actually , I have something here Is that ... No , no , no , this isn' t Adam' s book . No , it' s another client of mine . Yeah , perhaps you can let me know what you think . Sure . JOHN : Okay , if you' re gonna get that evening flight , we' d bitter talk contracts with Rick here . Wanna show our friend to the door ?\par
Would you ? Roy ? RlCK : Call you in an hour , buddy . JOHN : Remember ... ( IMlTATES BRlTISH ACCENT ) Heart . There' s something not quite right about this project . - What ? Me , you mean ?\par
- Obviously you . And McAra . Suicide ? He didn' t strike me as the suicidal type . Always nice to see you , Roy . ROY : Good luck . Oh , God . TAXI DRlVER : Thank you .\par
- Yeah ? - RlCK : Congratulations ! - On what ? - On having me as your agent . Yeah , I can hardly believe my luck . Are you packed ? I just got mugged . Shit ! Are you okay ?\par
Yeah , all they took was the manuscript that Sidney Kroll gave me . I don' t know . You tell me . Are you hurt ? No , I' m fine . I think they must have followed me from Rhinehart' s . Why would they do that ? Well , maybe they thought I had Lang' s book . I knew this whole thing was a bad idea . You' re still okay to fly tonight , right ?\par
For God' s sake , Rick , I' m in shock . Well , here' s another shock for you . For one month' s work on a manuscript that' s already written , Rhinehart Inc . is willing to pay you $250 , 000 , plus expenses . Window seat or aisle ? FEMALE NEWSREADER : ... Islam has issued a statement claiming responsibility . We hope to bring you more on that later in the bulletin . Meanwhile , former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is back in the news tonight . According to leaked documents , Mr. Lang authorized the illegal use of British special forces to seize four suspected al- Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan and then hand them over for interrogation by the ClA . The men , Nasir Ashraf , Marwat Sayed , Salim Khan and Faruk Ahmed , all British citizens , were seized in the Pakistani city of Peshawar five years ago .\par
All four were allegedly transferred out of the country to a secret location and tortured . Mr. Ashraf is reported to have died under interrogation . ( PHONE RlNGlNG ) Such an operation would have been illegal under ... - RlCK : Yeah ? - Where are you ? Heathrow , like you . Waiting for my flight to New York . Can you see the news ?\par
The Lang story ? Yeah , I' m watching it now . What have you gotten me into ? I got you into a quarter of a million bucks , pal , that' s what I got you into . They' re calling my flight . I gotta go . Listen , I just realized Sidney Kroll could have given me that manuscript deliberately so it would look like I was carrying Lang' s book . Why the hell would he do that ? I don' t know .\par
To use me as a tethered goat ? Get some sleep on the plane . You' re sounding weird . ( SCOFFS ) " A tethered goat " . I' il call you next week . FEMALE NEWSREADER : ... and long- term psychological trauma . In other words , torture . Hello , sir . Would you like a newspaper to read ? - Have you got the Evening Standard ?\par
- We do , yes . Thanks . Thank you . STEWARDESS : Hello , madam . Would you like a newspaper to read ? ( Lang Ordered Secret Kidnap ) WOMAN : Yes , please . Thank you .\par
Passport ? RUTH : This is an absolute scandal ! Amelia Bly . ( DOOR SLAMMlNG ) I' m Adam' s assistant . Adam' s in New York , unfortunately , and won' t be back until later this afternoon . RUTH : Actually , forget I said that , it' s bloody ridiculous ! ( DOOR SLAMS AGAlN ) ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , dear .\par
I' m so sorry . I' m afraid Ruth' s having one of those days . If this isn' t a good time , I could go to ... No , no . She' s keen to meet you . - Right . Shall we make a start ? - Right . - How was your journey ? - Long .\par
AMELlA : We' re a small team . GHOST : Thanks . AMELlA : This is Alice . Lucy' s traveling with Adam . We need another pair of hands , but Adam couldn' t bring himself to replace Mike . - They were together so long . - How long were you with him ?\par
AMELlA : Eight years . I' m an attachment from Number 10 . Ah . Poor Number 10 . Before I show you the manuscript , I need you to sign this confidentiality agreement . Sign here . And here . And here .\par
GHOST : Wow , quite a place . Don' t you get lonely at night ? It' s my husband I miss the most . Are you married ? I noticed you don' t wear a wedding ring . I can' t , sadly . It' s far too large . - It bleeps when I go through airport security . Here we are .\par
The manuscript is not to be removed from this room . It' s not to be copied . You have six hours before Adam gets in from New York . - Can you finish by then ? - I' il try . I' il ask Dep to bring you up a sandwich for lunch . Thanks . Have fun . " Langs are Scottish folk , originally , and proud of it . " Our name is a derivation of " long " , the Old English word for " tall " ,\par

" I always found the Queen , in private , to have a delightful sense of humor " . Thanks .\par
" I' ve always been an optimist . The present is where we live " . " Ruth and I look forward to the future , whatever it may hold " . The end . As bad as that ? Oh , hello . Will ? How bad is it ? You haven' t read it ? Not all of it .\par
- Well , let' s just say it needs some work . - How much work ? Well , all the words are there . They' re just in the wrong order . Come on . You look like you need a break . You were my idea . I was ? You wrote Christy Costello' s memoirs , didn' t you ? You read those ?\par
We stayed at his house in Mystique , last winter . The book was beside the bed . - I' m embarrassed . - No , why ? It was brilliant , in a horrible sort of way . How you turned his ramblings into something vaguely coherent . I said to Adam , " Here' s the guy to write your book , not Mike " . ( SlGHS ) God , I miss home . It' s like being married to Napoleon on St. Helena . - Why don' t you go back to London ?\par
- RUTH : I don' t feel I can leave him alone . There' s something not quite right with him at the moment . Amelia told me he was very upset at the death of Michael McAra . Oh , she did , did she ? Quite when Mrs. Bly became the expert on my husband' s emotions , I' m not sure . Losing Mike was a blow , of course , but it' s not just that . It' s having to relive everything , year by year , for this bloody book . Oh , dear . You must be wondering what you' ve let yourself in for .\par
Fine , fine . I' il tell him . They' re just about to land . On Thursday , he' s in Chicago . Actually , I think I' il go and meet him . Amelia can stay here and polish her nails or something . Why don' t you come , say hello ? Fine . I' il travel in the backup car . I can do my nails in there .\par
( CHUCKLlNG ) Hi , darling . - How was New York ? - Short and sweet . Hi , Barry . Hi , Amelia . Hello . Who are you ? I' m your ghost . Right .\par
Don' t worry . He isn' t always such a jerk . This place really comes alive at night . You' il be with us for four weeks , is that right ? I' m afraid so . And the bill goes directly to the Rhinehart Corporation ? Good . That doesn' t include the mini- bar . All right . He' s ready for you .\par
How' s your hotel ? Quiet ? Monastic . That' s nice . No distractions . Thanks , love . Hi , man . You ready to start ? Absolutely . - GHOST :\par
Is the manuscript loaded on this ? - It is . Can I have it ? AMELlA : I' m sorry , that would be a security risk . You mean I' ve got to retype the whole manuscript ? Have you really got my entire book on that little thing ? We can get 100 books on it , Adam . And it can be copied in a flash . That' s the trouble .\par
Amazing . You know the worst thing about my life ? You get so out of touch . Everything' s done for you . You don' t drive , you don' t carry money . If I need cash , I have to borrow it from the protection boys . This is the kind of details we need in the memoirs . I couldn' t put that in . People would think I was a complete idiot . No , not at all .\par
No , this shows what it' s like being Prime Minister . That' s exactly what the readers want to know . How does it feel to run a country ? How does it feel to be so cut off ? How does it feel to be so hated ? Thanks a lot . ( STAMMERS ) And so loved . Amelia , what do you think ? I think I should leave you two alone . So , how do we go about this ?\par
I Interview you . I turn your answers into prose . Here and there , I' il add linking passages , imitating your voice . Okay . - You heard about Mike ? - Yes . I' m sorry . We should put in something nice about him . I think his mother would like that . Of course .\par
Well , urn , the first thing that struck me was , you became such a successful politician precisely because you didn' t appear to be a politician . It' s certainly not something I wanted to do when I was younger . I thought most student politicians were complete nerds . Well , I' m with you there . So , what turned you on to politics ? Turned me on , indeed . Let' s see , I was 23 , something like that , a couple of years out of Cambridge . And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon , it was raining . I was still in bed . And someone starts knocking at the door .\par
And , you know , I' d been out the night before and had a few drinks and what have you . So , I get the pillow and I put it over my head , and it starts up again . Knock , knock , knock , knock ! And I get up , I' m swearing , I go to the door and there' s this girl . She' s soaking wet , but she just launches Into this speech about the local elections . And that' s it . - I' m in love . - And this is Ruth ? This is Ruth . And the only way I can see her again is to join the party and hand out leaflets .\par
This is great . You want to use this ? Use it ? I think we should open true whole book like this . " I went into politics out of love " , " not love for a party or an ideology , but out of love for a woman " . Could you transcribe this as quickly as possible , please ? Of course . - Thanks . - How' s it going ?\par
Pretty well . He keeps calling me " man " . He always does that when he can' t remember someone' s name . There are sandwiches in the kitchen . ( GRUNTlNG ) Oh , shit . It' s awful . I' m sorry , sir . I didn' t realize there was anyone up there . What on earth is going on ?\par
It' s just a security drill , sir . We have it once a week . So , there you are . I' d rather lost track of you . I' m a big boy now . Can' t keep your eye on me all the time . Don' t wander around on your own . The security boys don' t like it . Gotcha . - Did you win ?\par
- Didn' t play tennis . Gym ? What' s he in training for ? The Olympics ? Here' s your transcript . Cambridge . Let' s talk about that . Sorry ? Um ... Cambridge ?\par
It was such a long time ago , I can hardly remember . You did a lot of acting ? Some . It must have been good training for politics , acting ? It was a good way to meet girls . Let' s not put that in , by the way , okay ? Still , acting must have been very important to you . Okay , let' s say I enjoyed it . You know , you go on the stage , pretend to be somebody else , and people actually applaud you for it . Good , that' s more like it .\par
Let' s put that in . - No . - Why not ? Because these are the memoirs of a Prime Minister . And whenever my opponents were stuck with something to hit me with , they always said I was a bloody actor ! Do you know what the Times of London said the day I resigned ? " Kindly leave the stage " . So , no , we won' t dwell , if you don' t mind , on my student days as an actor . We leave it exactly the way Mike wrote it . Would you like to take a break for a minute ?\par
Actually , that would be a good idea , thank you . I need to make a call . AMELlA : What a bastard . Look at this . " Former British Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart " " has asked the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate allegations " " that the former British Prime Minister Adam Lang " " for torture by the ClA " . ( PHONE RlNGlNG )\par
Don' t ! The pack is on the move . Unplug all the phones . Is Ruth still out walking ? Shit ! She is , isn' t she ? - Barry ! Barry ! - Yeah . Would you please find Mrs. Lang and get her back here as soon as you can ?\par
- Right . - AMELlA : Let' s go . - Rycart has made a statement . - Yes , I know . - He just called me . - AMELlA : It' s unbelievable . He wanted very much to let me know it was nothing personal . He wanted very , very much to tell me that it was only because of his well- known stand on human rights that he couldn' t keep quiet any longer .\par
" His well- known stand on human rights " . Dear God ! - Sorry to lose my temper earlier . - Forget it . And have you told her ? ADAM : Yes . Just called her . AMELlA : And how did she take it ?\par
Sorry , Adam . This is running on AP . " According to sources in The Hague " , " the prosecutor' s office of the International Criminal Court " " will issue a statement in the morning " . AMELlA : Oh , Adam . Thank you , Alice . Why weren' t we given some warning of this ? Where' s Downing Street ?\par
The phones are disconnected . Switch is probably trying to get through now . Now ? What freaking use is now ? What are you people doing ? I mean , you' re not telling me that the Cabinet Office didn' t know this was coming ? The war crimes court doesn' t warn a suspect who' s under investigation . That' s what Adam is now , a suspect ? You need to call Sid Kroll . I think we should call London first .\par
Adam ! If it suits them , they will hang you out to dry . - You need a lawyer . Call Sid . - ( ADAM SlGHS ) - Get Sid on the line . - What about the media ? Issue a holding statement , something short . This is when we need Mike . I' il write something .\par
Let him do it . He' s supposed to be the writer . - Hang on a minute . - ADAM : I should sound confident . Not defensive , that' d be fatal . But I shouldn' t be cocky . No bitterness , no anger , and don' t say " I' m pleased at this opportunity to clear my name " or any balls like that . So , you' re not defensive , but you' re not cocky .\par
You' re not angry , but you' re not pleased ? - ADAM : That' s it . - Then what exactly are you ? Told you he was funny . I' ve always been a passionate supporter ... No , scrub that . I' ve always been a strong , no , committed supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court . You' re the writer . The struggle against terror is too important to be used for the purposes of personal revenge .\par
Very good . You could be the new Mike McAra . - Hello ? - JOHN : John Maddox . This is gonna be big . This can only be good for us . - Could be . - Here' s the first chapter right here . Okay .\par
What' ve you covered so far ? Um ... The early years , childhood , university . All right , forget that crap . Get him focused on the war crimes . And he can' t talk to anybody else , all right ? - Right . - It' s gotta be our exclusive . Any chance of you finishing the manuscript sooner ? Sooner ?\par
Yeah , yeah , sooner . Well , how much sooner ? I' m thinking two weeks . Jesus . Look , I know it' s tough , but if anyone can do it , you can . I' m relying on you . We' il talk . Shit . I' d never have guessed you smoked . I only allow myself one at times of great stress or contentment .\par
- And which is this ? - Very funny . Maddox just called . He wants the book in two weeks instead of four . Christ . Good luck . Yeah , I wouldn' t mind a lift back to my hotel . I could get on with some work there . You' re not planning on taking that manuscript - out of here , are you ?\par
- Course not . Because you do realize how serious this is getting , don' t you ? - You can search me , if you like . - That won' t be necessary . All right . Fetch your stuff . I' il get one of the boys to take you . Mr. Lang insisted he had always been a committed supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court . Mr. Lang added , quote , " The struggle against terror is too important "\par
" to be used for the purposes of personal revenge " . - Same again , sir ? - This is being widely interpreted as ... - Yes , thanks . - ... an attack on the former British Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart , who has asked ...

That makes you an accomplice .\par
So , here' s the score . You' re not being charged , you' re not being arrested . None of this is gonna amount to a hill of beans . The only thing the prosecutor is asking for is permission to launch a formal investigation . - Investigating me for what ? - Connie ? Either crimes against humanity or war crimes . Well , that' s absurd . It' s not exactly genocide . " Under Article 25 , a person shall be guilty of a war crime "\par
" if that person facilitates the commission of such a crime " " or aids , abets or otherwise assists in its commission " . - That' s rather sweeping . - Well , if it' s any comfort , you' re in no jeopardy as long as you stay here , among friends .

Oh , God . Okay , we need to get you to Washington , Adam , right away . My plane is at the airport . We can get you in to see the Speaker of the House at lunchtime and have a photo- op with the Secretary of State in the afternoon . Won' t it look as if I' m panicking ? No , they' il both say that the meetings were fixed weeks ago . Well , what the hell are we supposed to be discussing ? SlDNEY : AlDS ? Poverty ?\par
Climate change ? Who cares ? The important thing is to show the world it' s business as usual . - What do you think , Ruth ? - I think it' s a terrible idea .

I regret that he' s chosen to bring this down to a personal level . This isn' t personal . This is about justice .\par
This is about making sure every political leader knows when they make a decision , they will be held to account by international law . Thank you .

You' d better pack one for yourself . Why don' t you share a suitcase ?\par
It' s so much more convenient . I' il see you tomorrow . I' m sorry to abandon you . At least this might help sales . Perhaps Rhinehart' s PR department organized the whole thing . Well , fell them to stop it , will you ? Okay , people , remember , happy , happy faces . MALE RERORTER : So , just to summarize what we know so far , it' s now official , the special prosecutor of the International War Crimes Court is to launch an investigation ... ... the special prosecutor announced she was going to investigate Mr. Lang , well , there was a big cheer , I can tell you .\par
So , let' s talk to some of these protestors . - You , sir , you' re English , I believe . - Yes , I am . So , what brings you so far from home ? My son . He was killed in one of Mr. Lang' s illegal wars . Lang' s never visited the injured . He' s never apologized . I was in the British Army for 30 years . It' s a disgrace !\par

Well , that' s what everyone wants to know . What brings you to this part of the island ? I' m sightseeing . Well , you sure picked a heck of a day for it . Someone I knew was found washed up on the beach there . - You mean the British guy from the ferry ?\par
- That' s right . - Now that was a funny business . - What do you mean ? No way should that current have carried him that far west . - No ? - No way ! Are you sure ? I' ve lived here 54 years . Did you mention that to the police ? The police ?\par
At my age , I' ve better things to do , young man . Annabeth' s the one dealing with the police . Your wife ? Annabeth Wurmbrand , Mars Wurmbrand' s widow .

Could you point me in the direction of Mrs. Wurmbrand' s house ? Oh , sure . You just ... Here . Follow it down the beach there . It' s the house nearest the ocean . But she won' t talk to you . - Why not ? - She' s in a coma . Fell down stairs a week ago .\par

I suppose it doesn' t really matter . He was drunk . He drowned . End of story . - What was he doing on the ferry ? - No idea . Funeral' s on Monday , in London . I' m thinking of going . One of us should put in an appearance , and it doesn' t seem likely to be my husband . I thought you didn' t want to leave him .\par
Rather seems as though he' s left me , wouldn' t you say ? - Hello ? - Sorry . I did knock . It' s just me . - I brought you some dry clothes . - That' s all right . I can manage . Dinner' s in an hour , okay ? Fine , thanks .\par

I find it difficult to understand certain things . - What things ? - Well ... I can' t understand why this good- looking lad who goes to Cambridge without the slightest interest in politics and who spends his time acting and chasing girls , - suddenly ends up ... - Married to me ? Oh , no , not that . No , not that , at all . No , what I don' t get is why , at 22 , he' s suddenly a political activist . - I mean , where does that come from ?\par
- Didn' t you ask him ? He said he joined the party because of you . Told me a great story about you turning up at his place in the rain . - I was gonna start the whole book with it , - And now you' re not ? No , I can' t . It' s not true . - Isn' t it ? - Well , you know it' s not . He' d been a member for two years before he met you . How do you know that ?\par
I' ve got a copy off his original party membership card . Mike McAra found it in the archives . Typical Mike , to ruin a good story with too much research . Did he find anything else ? Not much . Cambridge stuff mainly . You were more political than he was . I was certainly a change from his Cambridge girlfriends . All those Jocastas and Pandoras . And so his marriage to you must have been pretty vital , your knowledge and your contacts in the party .\par
And I thought he married me for my body . Did you ever want to be a proper politician in your own right ? Of course . Didn' t you want to be a proper writer ? Ouch . I' m sorry . I' ve hurt your feelings . I suppose even ghosts must have feelings . We are sensitive spirits . Talking of spirits , could you ...\par
Let me get you a proper drink . White wine , never really seen the point of it . That' s the sort of thing Mike used to say . Ah ! At last , something in common . Do you know the coroner reckoned he' d drunk nearly half a bottle ? That' s convenient . - What do you mean ? - Nothing . - You think his death was suspicious ?\par
- Don' t you ? Yes . Yes , I do . Today at the beach , I met a man , an old timer who was familiar with the currents . And he said that there was no way that a body from the ferry could have washed ashore on that spot . You' re kidding . He also said that there was a woman who saw flashlights on the beach that night . And then she fell down the stairs , and now she' s in a coma . That' s all I know .\par
That' s all you know ? Jesus . - Can I borrow your phone ? I need to call Adam . - What ? - Nothing . - Aren' t you gonna call him ? - Later . I' m going out for a walk . But it' s pitch black .\par

- I' m sorry . It' s all right . Hang on . - What time is it ? - I don' t know . I called Adam . - And ? - Can I come in ? The day before Mike died , he and Adam had a terrible row . I' ve never told anyone this before , not even the police .\par
- What about ? - I don' t know . But it was furious . They never spoke again . When I asked Adam about it , he refused to discuss it . After what you just said , I felt I should ask him again . And what did he say ? He was having dinner with the Vice President . That bloody Bly woman wouldn' t even give him the phone . ( SOBBlNG ) Oh , God .\par
Oh , dear God . What' s he got himself mixed up in ? It' s all right . Everything ' !! be all right . I' m scared . I' ve never been scared in my life before , but I am now . Your hair' s all wet , you' re drenched . Let me get you a towel . ( SOFTLY ) Bad idea . Do you mind ?\par

Why ? I' m just the wife . Yeah , even so . You ought not to be written out of history . Why not ? Most women are . Then I' il reinstate you . I' il put in all the occasions that he' s forgotten . How kind . Like the boss' s secretary that remembers his wife' s birthday for him ?\par
Something like that . But then , like you say , I' m not a proper writer . - What are you planning to do ? - Leave . It' s not necessary , as far as I' m concerned . I' m afraid it is , as far as I am . - Where will you go ? - Back to the hotel . Look , I' m sorry . I should never have stayed in a client' s house .\par
- It always ends up with ... - With you screwing the client' s wife ? No , not always . But it does make it hard to maintain a professional distance . And the thing we discussed last night ? What do you propose to do about that ? - That' s none of my business . - Well , you can' t just ignore it Look , I' m his ghostwriter . I' m not an investigative reporter .\par

Oh , really ? Well , now it' s my turn to be surprised . What does he say ? That' s very decent of him . As Prime Minister , he always had good instincts . - But that doesn' t mean I know him . - But the ... That ...

He just kept saying if anything happened to him , the truth was in Lang' s memoirs . " It' s all there in the beginning " . The beginning ? Then he means Cambridge . What the hell' s this ? That is Lang , and that is Paul Emmett . Emmett ? The Arcadia guy . So what ? On the day that Mike McAra died , he drove up to see Emmett , and I think he was murdered on his way home .\par

Emmett ? - Foreign Resources Division . - Oh , my God . You realize how important this is , don' t you ? This explains why Lang went into politics .\par
Everyone knows he didn' t have a political thought in his pretty little head . This is why he rose so quickly , with a little help from his friends . - Well , do you think it' s possible ... - Okay , a quiz for you . Name one decision Lang made in 10 years as Prime Minister which wasn' t in the interests of the USA . Well , come on , it' s not a trick question . Iraq , Middle East policy , Star Wars defense , buying American nuclear missiles , support of terrorist rendition . The sacking of any minister Washington didn' t like , including yours truly . McAra was right . This explains everything .\par
It' s Amelia Bly . Answer it . - Hello , Amelia . - Good evening . I have Adam for you . ( SOFTLY ) Lang . ADAM : We' re coming to get you . What ? Ruth tells me you' re stuck at the ferry terminal .\par
We' ve just taken off from New York Pilot says we can stop by and pick you up . Really ? There' s no need . We' ve got a book to write , remember ? Hold on a sec , Adam . ( SOFTLY ) He said he wants to pick me up in his private jet . - Say yes . - What if it' s a trap ? If you refuse , he' il get suspicious .\par
Tell him yes . That' d be great , Adam . Yeah , thanks . I' il get to the airport . See you there . He sounds worried . I really don' t think this is a good idea . You have no choice . Emmett must have told Lang that I' d been to see him . So , what' s he gonna do about it ?\par
Dump you in the ocean ? - Well , it happened before ! - Which means it can' t happen again . He can' t drown two ghostwriters , for God' s sake . You' re not kittens . All this is just theory . We don' t have any proof . - You' il get us the proof . - Me ? You' re his ghostwriter .\par
Presumably , he lets you tape him . - I use discs , actually . - Discs , tapes . You' ve got to confront him with this . Record his reaction . Even if he denies it , it' s something . I' m in a tricky position here . I signed a confidentiality agreement . It' s a bit late for that . - It means the discs are his property .\par
- The court can subpoena them . And what if I don' t record any discs ? Then you' il be subpoenaed and forced to repeat this whole story . Then I' il deny it . Then I' il give them this . Frank is recording every word . Aren' t you , Frank ? Oh ! Come on ! Don' t look so shocked .\par
What did you expect ? That I' d come into a meeting with a man working for Lang without taking any precautions ? Except you' re not working for Lang anymore . You' re working for the good guys . You know all this is pointless , don' t you ? In the end , he' il just retire over here with his ClA pension , and he' il tell you and the bloody war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves . Good evening , sir . Hatherton welcomes you aboard . Thank you . It' s my first time in a private jet .\par
Well , let' s hope it' s not your last . Hi , man . - Take your seat . - Thanks . - Hey , bring my ghost a Calvados . - Yes , sir . Do you mind ? Leave it off for now . Ruth said you were in New York to see Maddox . - That' s right .\par
- How was he ? He was fine . Full of energy ? - You know John . - Yes , I do know John . As a matter of fact , I was just with him . You never saw him today , did you ? No . Do you have something to tell me ? I went to see Emmett .\par
( LAUGHlNG ) That windbag ! Why ? I know about you and Emmett . - Me and Emmett ? - I know that he was your ... - My ? - ... handler , if that' s what they' re called . - My handler ? - Yeah , that he was your handler in the ClA . Oh , my God . You' re serious , aren' t you ?\par
When McAra found this , he went to Boston to show it to Emmett , and he died on the way home , and I think he was murdered . I think you' ve had a few too many of those already . It was McAra who believed that Emmett told you to go into politics in the first place . - Emmett ? I barely knew the man . - And that story of yours about why you joined the party and Ruth and the canvassing , well , the dates don' t fit . I got the dates wrong . Big deal ! Then when he found this photograph , and he heard the rumors about Emmett being in the ClA ... - Rumors ?\par
- It' s on the Internet . I' ve never heard such utter balls in my entire life . Mike would never have believed such crap . He was too clever . Too loyal . Mike betrayed you to Rycart . - How do you know that ? - He told me . Rycart ? He' s lying .\par
This phone number on the back of the photograph , it' s Rycart' s . The handwriting , that' s McAra' s . Mike . - Mike , Mike . - And you knew he was disillusioned . You had a big row with him just before he died . Yes , I know , but he never mentioned this . This is just ... This is grotesque . I' ve never taken orders from anyone .\par
Whatever I did , I did because I believed it was right . What , even supporting illegal kidnapping for torture ? Oh , for God' s sake , spare me the bleeding- heart bullshit ! Do you know what I' d do if I was in power again ? I' d have two queues at airports . One for flights where we' d done no background checks , infringed on no one' s civil bloody liberties , used no intelligence gained by torture . And on the other flight , we' d do everything we possibly could to make it perfectly safe . And then we' d see which plane the Rycarts of this world would put their bloody kids on ! ( SHOUTlNG ) And you can put that in the book ! MAN :\par
Go home ! WOMAN : Go home ! MAN : Here comes the killer ! WOMAN : Prosecute for torture ! FEMALE REPORTER : Over here , Mr. Lang ! Mr. Lang !\par
Mr. Lang , will you live in America ? Mr. Lang , will you take American citizenship ? When we get back to the house , we need to have a meeting . - RUTH : Oh , my God ! - Murderer ! BODYGUARD : Firing from the roof ! RUTH : Let me go to him !\par
No ! No ! Move , move , move ! FBI AGENT 1 : How long had you known Mr. Lang ? - Couple of days . - In what capacity ? I was his ghost . His ghostwriter . Do you recognize this man ?\par
He was one of the protestors . His son was killed in Iraq . Did you ever speak with him ? He was in the bar one night in the hotel where I was staying . FBI AGENT 2 : But did you speak with him ? He asked me if I knew where Adam Lang was staying on the island . - I told him that I didn' t . - Did you report this conversation ? Sorry ?\par
Did you report this conversation to Mr. Lang' s protection team ? No . What was Mr. Lang' s demeanor this evening ? He was ... He was fine . He seemed fine . One witness said she thought she heard Mr. Lang shouting at you . No . - We' re gonna need your passport . A serious crime was just committed in US territory , and you' re the key witness .\par
We need to keep you close . MALE RERORTER : Like a fallen soldier , Adam Lang went home today , home to a shocked and grieving nation . Not just his family , but friends and political opponents joined in tribute . A great colleague and a true patriot . We had our disagreements , but we always stayed friends . My heart goes out to Ruth and the family . And I would like to say Adam will be ... ( SWlTCHES TV OFF ) Who is it ? RlCK :\par
Congratulations ! On what now ? Still having me as your agent . Hmm ? They don' t need you anymore . You' re free to go . - You ready to get back to work ? - I don' t think I can , Rick . - I' m sorry . Not after all this .\par
- Don' t be a jerk . This is a hot book now . It' s Adam Lang' s voice from the grave . - The guy , he' s a hero . - I just want to go home . You can . Go . Go home . And finish the book from London , I don' t know , Rick .\par
Here we are . Oh , here we are . I' m sorry . I think I' m over it , and then suddenly I realize I' m not . - Are you sure this is all right ? - Of course . My invitation said plus one . Only I wondered if you might' ve wanted to bring your husband . That didn' t work out . I hadn' t appreciated quite how bored he was with being my plus one .\par
- Shall we go in ? - Yeah . - Amelia Bly , plus one . - Thank you . That was a bit of a turn- up , for the books , you calling me . I heard you weren' t invited , and I thought you should be here . Ghosts are never invited to the launch party , as a rule . We' re an embarrassment . Like a mistress at a wedding . Sorry .\par
I brought you a present . Thank you . ( Memoirs by Adam Lang ) ( CHUCKLES ) That' s very funny . I thought , seeing as you were so keen to hold on it . You might like it as a souvenir . Between you and me , it wasn' t us , it was the Americans . They thought the book was a potential threat to national security . But there' s nothing in it . Something about the beginnings .\par
I think that' s what I heard . - The beginning ? - No , beginnings . The beginnings . Beginnings ? You all right ? Do you know that man ? The one who' s speaking to Ruth . - Paul Emmett ? - What' s he doing here ?\par
Well , he was Ruth' s tutor at Harvard when she was a Fulbright scholar . Why shouldn' t he be here ? Do you mind if I have that back a second ? WAlTRESS : Madam ? WOMAN : No , thank you . " Langs are Scottish folk , originally " . " Wife and child in tow , I decided to ... " " I decided to settle " .\par
MAN : Ladies and gentlemen , if I could have your attention , please . Thank you . I' d like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words . I miss Adam all the time . But never more than tonight . Not just ' cause we' re meeting to launch his wonderful new book and he should be here to share the joy of his life story with us , but because he was so brilliant at making speeches and I' m so terrible . " Langs are Scottish folk " . " Wife and child , Langs are Scottish " . " Wife , Langs .\par
Lang' s wife " . " Lang' s " " wife Ruth " " was recruited " " as a ClA agent " " by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University " . RUTH : Well , you' il be relieved to hear I' m not making a speech this evening . I just want to thank our wonderful publishers , Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox , and our attorney and friend , Sidney Kroll . And finally , but especially , Mike McAra . Mike , our thoughts are with you . In these very difficult few months , I' ve drawn great comfort from this book , from knowing that , despite the terrible double tragedy of losing both of them ,\par
Mike and Adam did at least live long enough to complete it . And I really believe that , as people read these pages , Adam' s voice will keep on coming through for generations to come , eloquent , strong and full of hope . Thanks to his words , he is with us still . If I' ve left out anyone' s name , I hope you' il forgive me . But now I must make a toast . To the memory of a great man ( Ruth Lang ) and a great patriot , a wonderful husband and a devoted father . To Adam ! ALL : To Adam !\par
You were marvelous . MAN : Would you ... This one looks nasty . Yeah , it' s just happened just now . Yeah , if you could . " The Ghost Writer " Come on ! But you realize I know nothing about politics ? - You voted for him , didn' t you ?\par
- Adam Lang ? Of course I did . Everyone voted for him . He wasn' t a politician , he was a craze . Well , there you go . Look , it' s a new ghostwriter he needs , not another goddamn politico . He was paid $10 million for these memoirs , but rumor has it the manuscript' s a crock of shit . Rhinehart' s lending him his house at the ocean so they can fix it , and the pressure must have gotten to McAra . Pathologist said his blood was , like , three parts booze . You mean he drowned by accident ?\par
Accident , suicide , who cares ? It was the book that killed him . Well , that' s encouraging . Who is this McAra ? Should I have heard of him ? Yeah . He was some kind of aide to Lang when he was Prime Minister , so don' t admit that you haven' t . He was with him for years . I don' t know , Rick . This is a great opportunity for you .\par
Plus the money is good . Kids won' t starve . - I don' t have any kids . - I do . Roy . Who' re you expecting to bomb you , Random House ? We' re publishing Lang' s memoirs . That' s enough to make us a target , apparently . Thank you . - How many have you seen ?\par
- Five . You' re the last . I must be honest . I don' t think you' re the right man for this assignment . Then it' s a good job it' s not your decision , Roy . John Maddox , chief executive of Rhinehart , New York . Sir . Sidney Kroll , Mr. Lang' s Washington attorney . Mr. Kroll . And Nick Ricardelli I believe you know .\par
All right , Rick . All right , I gather from Rick you' re aware of the situation ? Perhaps you can enlighten us and tell us what exactly you' re gonna bring to this project . Nothing . No , I' m not gonna pretend to be someone I' m not . You have my CV . His last effort was the autobiography of a magician , I Came , I Sawed , I Conquered . Yeah , and it went straight to number one , so ... After you turned it down , Roy .\par
Look , I don' t read politicaI memoirs . Who does ? And I gather you' ve spent $10 million on this book . How much of that are you gonna see back ? Two ? Three ? It' s bad news for your shareholders . And it' s worse news for your client , Mr. Kroll . Adam Lang , he wants a place in history , not in the remainder tables . Oh , please !\par
It' s because I know nothing about politics that I' il ask the questions that get right to the heart of who Adam Lang is . And that is what sells autobiographies . Heart . Wow ! That' s nicely done . - What utter balls . - You think so ? John , of course . Adam Lang' s a world historicaI figure . His autobiography is gonna be a world- publishing event .\par
Yeah , well , I got warehouses filled with world- publishing events waiting to be pulped . Sid ? Adam is obviously still very upset by what happened to Mike McAra . He was irreplaceable . Irreplaceable , and yet he has to be replaced . Adam can certainly appreciate the benefits of trying someone different . In the end , it' s about chemistry . Do you work out , maybe ? - Not really . - That' s a pity .\par
Adam likes to work out . Actually , I know a good writer on the Guardian who uses a gym . Okay , maybe we could just run over the publishing schedule , yeah ? We need to wrap this up in a month . A month ? - Yes . - You want the book in a month ? - We already have a first draft . Yeah , well , it needs a lot of work . That' s why I like your r\'c3\'a9sum\'c3\'a9 here .\par
You' re fast , and you deliver . You name it , he ghosts it . And you' re a Brit . The ghost should be a Brit . To get the jolly old tone right , right ? - Do you have any family commitments ? - No , I have no family . Why ? Adam is locked into a US lecture tour , also a fundraising program for the Adam Lang Foundation . It' s a month in the States .\par
That' s okay . Couldn' t I bring the manuscript back here to work on ? I' m afraid not . It' s in a secure environment in Marty Rhinehart' s own house . Only a few people are allowed to handle it . Sounds more like a bomb than a book . I will need to see it myself at some point . I am supposed to be editing it . Yeah , in theory . Actually , we need to talk about that .\par
How soon can you get over there ? - As soon as you want . - He' il fly tonight . - Rick . It' s okay . Okay , you' re in . - Congratulations . - Thank you . Thanks . - Rick .\par
- Thank you . Actually , I have something here No , no , no , this isn' t Adam' s book . No , it' s another client of mine . Yeah , perhaps you can let me know what you think . Sure . Okay , if you' re gonna get that evening flight , we' d better talk contracts with Rick here . Wanna show our friend to the door ? Would you ? Roy ?\par
Call you in an hour , buddy . Hey ! Remember ... Heart . There' s something not quite right about this project . - What ? Me , you mean ? - Obviously you . And McAra . Suicide ?\par
He didn' t strike me as the suicidaI type . Always nice to see you , Roy . Good luck . Oh , God . Thank you . - Yeah ? Congratulations ! - On what ? - On having me as your agent . Yeah , I can hardly believe my luck .\par
Are you packed ? I just got mugged . Shit ! Are you okay ? Yeah , all they took was the manuscript that Sidney Kroll gave me . What ? Why ? I don' t know . You tell me . Are you hurt ?\par
No , I' m fine . I think they must have followed me from Rhinehart' s . Why would they do that ? Well , maybe they thought I had Lang' s book . I knew this whole thing was a bad idea . You' re still okay to fly tonight , right ? For God' s sake , Rick , I' m in shock . Well , here' s another shock for you . For one month' s work on a manuscript that' s already written , Rhinehart Inc . is willing to pay you $250, 000 , plus expenses .\par
Window seat or aisle ? ... Islam has issued a statement claiming responsibility . We hope to bring you more on that later in the bulletin . Meanwhile , former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is back in the news tonight . According to leaked documents , Mr. Lang authorized the illegaI use of British speciaI forces to seize four suspected al- Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan and then hand them over for interrogation by the ClA . The men , Nasir Ashraf , Marwat Sayed , Salim Khan and Faruk Ahmed , all British citizens , were seized in the Pakistani city of Peshawar five years ago . All four were allegedly transferred out of the country to a secret location and tortured . Mr. Ashraf is reported to have died under interrogation . Such an operation would have been illegaI under ... Yeah ? - Where are you ?\par
Heathrow , like you . Waiting for my flight to New York . Can you see the news ? The Lang story ? Yeah , I' m watching it now . What have you gotten me into ? I got you into a quarter of a million bucks , pal , that' s what I got you into . They' re calling my flight . I gotta go . Listen , I just realized\par
Sidney Kroll could have given me that manuscript deliberately so it would look like I was carrying Lang' s book . Why the hell would he do that ? I don' t know . To use me as a tethered goat ? Get some sleep on the plane . You' re sounding weird . " A tethered goat . " I' il call you next week . ... and long- term psychologicaI trauma . In other words , torture . Hello , sir . Would you like a newspaper to read ?\par
- Have you got the Evening Standard ? - We do , yes . Thanks . Thank you . Hello , madam . Would you like a newspaper to read ? Yes , please . Thank you . Passport ? This is an absolute scandal !\par
Amelia Bly . Welcome . I' m Adam' s assistant . Adam' s in New York , unfortunately , and won' t be back untiI later this afternoon . Actually , forget I said that , it' s bloody ridiculous ! Oh , dear . I' m so sorry . I' m afraid Ruth' s having one of those days . If this isn' t a good time , I could go to ... No , no .\par
She' s keen to meet you . - Right . Shall we make a start ? - Right . - How was your journey ? - Long . We' re a small team . Thanks . This is Alice . Lucy' s traveling with Adam .\par
We need another pair of hands , but Adam couldn' t bring himself to replace Mike . - They were together so long . - How long were you with him ? Eight years . I' m an attachment from Number 10 . Ah . Poor Number 10 . Before I show you the manuscript , I need you to sign this confidentiality agreement . Sign here .\par
And here . And here . Wow , quite a place . Don' t you get lonely at night ? It' s my husband I miss the most . Are you married ? I noticed you don' t wear a wedding ring . I can' t , sadly . It' s far too large . - It bleeps when I go through airport security .\par
- Oh . Here we are . The manuscript is not to be removed from this room . It' s not to be copied . You have six hours before Adam gets in from New York . - Can you finish by then ? - I' il try . I' il ask Dep to bring you up a sandwich for lunch . Thanks . Have fun .\par
" Langs are Scottish folk , originally , and proud of it . " Our name is a derivation of ' long , ' the Old English word for ' tall , ' " and it is from north of the border that my forefathers hail . " Fuck . " My great- grandfather , Ebenezer Lang , " was born in 1862 in Pitlochry , Scotland . " One of nine children , seven of them boys . " " The American President was much taller than I had expected . " " This year' s European summit was particularly interesting . " " I always found the Queen , in private , to have a delightfuI sense of humor . "\par
Thanks . " I' ve always been an optimist . The present is where we live . " Ruth and I look forward to the future , whatever it may hold . " As bad as that ? Oh , hello . Well ? How bad is it ? You haven' t read it ? Not all of it .\par
- Well , let' s just say it needs some work . - How much work ? Well , all the words are there . They' re just in the wrong order . Come on . You look like you need a break . You were my idea . I was ? You wrote Christy Costello' s memoirs , didn' t you ? You read those ?\par
We stayed at his house in Mustique , last winter . The book was beside the bed . - I' m embarrassed . - No , why ? It was brilliant , in a horrible sort of way . How you turned his ramblings into something vaguely coherent . I said to Adam , " Here' s the guy to write your book , not Mike . " God , I miss home . It' s like being married to Napoleon on St. Helena . - Why don' t you go back to London ?\par
I don' t feeI I can leave him alone . There' s something not quite right with him at the moment . Amelia told me he was very upset at the death of MichaeI McAra . Oh , she did , did she ? Quite when Mrs. Bly became the expert on my husband' s emotions , I' m not sure . Losing Mike was a blow , of course , but it' s not just that . It' s having to relive everything , year by year , for this bloody book . Oh , dear . You must be wondering what you' ve let yourself in for . Fine , fine .\par
I' il tell him . They' re just about to land . On Thursday , he' s in Chicago . Actually , I think I' il go and meet him . Amelia can stay here and polish her nails or something . Why don' t you come , say hello ? Fine . I' il traveI in the backup car . I can do my nails in there . Hi , darling .\par
- How was New York ? - Short and sweet . Hi , Barry . Hi , Amelia . Hello . Who are you ? I' m your ghost . Right . Don' t worry . He isn' t always such a jerk .\par
This place really comes alive at night . You' il be with us for four weeks , is that right ? I' m afraid so . And the bill goes directly to the Rhinehart Corporation ? Good . That doesn' t include the mini- bar . All right . He' s ready for you . How' s your hotel ? Quiet ?\par
Monastic . That' s nice . No distractions . Thanks , love . Hi , man . You ready to start ? Absolutely . Is the manuscript loaded on this ? - It is . Can I have it ?\par
I' m sorry , that would be a security risk . You mean I' ve got to retype the whole manuscript ? Have you really got my entire book on that little thing ? We can get 100 books on it , Adam . And it can be copied in a flash . That' s the trouble . Amazing . You know the worst thing about my life ? You get so out of touch . Everything' s done for you .\par
You don' t drive , you don' t carry money . If I need cash , I have to borrow it from the protection boys . This is the kind of details we need in the memoirs . I couldn' t put that in . People would think I was a complete idiot . No , not at all . No , this shows what it' s like being Prime Minister . That' s exactly what the readers want to know . How does it feeI to run a country ? How does it feeI to be so cut off ?\par
How does it feeI to be so hated ? Thanks a lot . And so loved . Amelia , what do you think ? I think I should leave you two alone . So , how do we go about this ? I interview you . I turn your answers into prose . Here and there , I' il add linking passages , imitating your voice . Okay .\par
- You heard about Mike ? - Yes . I' m sorry . We should put in something nice about him . I think his mother would like that . Of course . Well , um , the first thing that struck me was , you became such a successfuI politician precisely because you didn' t appear to be a politician . It' s certainly not something I wanted to do when I was younger . I thought most student politicians were complete nerds . Well , I' m with you there .\par
So , what turned you on to politics ? Turned me on , indeed . Let' s see , I was 23 , something like that , a couple of years out of Cambridge . And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon , it was raining . I was still in bed . And someone starts knocking at the door . And , you know , I' d been out the night before and had a few drinks and what have you . So , I get the pillow and I put it over my head , and it starts up again . Knock , knock , knock , knock ! And I get up , I' m swearing , I go to the door and there' s this girl .\par
She' s soaking wet , but she just launches into this speech about the locaI elections . And that' s it . - I' m in love . - And this is Ruth ? This is Ruth . And the only way I can see her again is to join the party and hand out leaflets . This is great . You want to use this ? Use it ? I think we should open the whole book like this .\par
" I went into politics out of love , " not love for a party or an ideology , but out of love for a woman . " Could you transcribe this as quickly as possible , please ? Of course . - Thanks . - How' s it going ? Pretty well . He keeps calling me " man . " He always does that when he can' t remember someone' s name . There are sandwiches in the kitchen .\par
Oh , shit . It' s awful . I' m sorry , sir . I didn' t realize there was anyone up there . What on earth is going on ? It' s just a security drill , sir . We have it once a week . So , there you are . I' d rather lost track of you . I' m a big boy now .\par
Can' t keep your eye on me all the time . Don' t wander around on your own . The security boys don' t like it . Gotcha . - Did you win ? - Didn' t play tennis . Gym . Gym ? What' s he in training for ? The Olympics ?\par
Here' s your transcript . Cambridge . Let' s talk about that . Sorry ? Um ... Cambridge ? It was such a long time ago , I can hardly remember . You did a lot of acting ? Some . It must have been good training for politics , acting ?\par
It was a good way to meet girls . Let' s not put that in , by the way , okay ? Still , acting must have been very important to you . Okay , let' s say I enjoyed it . You know , you go on the stage , pretend to be somebody else , and people actually applaud you for it . Good , that' s more like it . Let' s put that in . - No . - Why not ? Because these are the memoirs of a Prime Minister .\par
And whenever my opponents were stuck with something to hit me with , they always said I was a bloody actor ! Do you know what the Times of London said the day I resigned ? " Kindly leave the stage . " So , no , we won' t dwell , if you don' t mind , on my student days as an actor . We leave it exactly the way Mike wrote it . Would you like to take a break for a minute ? Actually , that would be a good idea , thank you . I need to make a call . What a bastard . Look at this .\par
" Former British Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart " has asked the InternationaI CriminaI Court in The Hague to investigate allegations " that the former British Prime Minister Adam Lang " for torture by the ClA . " Don' t ! The pack is on the move . Unplug all the phones . Is Ruth still out walking ? Shit ! She is , isn' t she ?\par
- Barry ! Barry ! - Yeah . Would you please find Mrs. Lang and get her back here as soon as you can ? - Right . Let' s go . - Rycart has made a statement . - Yes , I know . - He just called me . It' s unbelievable .\par
He wanted very much to let me know it was nothing personal . He wanted very , very much to tell me that it was only because of his well- known stand on human rights that he couldn' t keep quiet any longer . " His well- known stand on human rights . " Dear God ! - Sorry to lose my temper earlier . - Forget it . And have you told her ? Yes . Just called her . And how did she take it ? Sorry , Adam .\par
This is running on AP . " According to sources in The Hague , " the prosecutor' s office of the InternationaI CriminaI Court " will issue a statement in the morning . " Oh , Adam . Thank you , Alice . Why weren' t we given some warning of this ? Where' s Downing Street ? The phones are disconnected . Switch is probably trying to get through now .\par
Now ? What freaking use is now ? What are you people doing ? I mean , you' re not telling me that the Cabinet Office didn' t know this was coming ? The war crimes court doesn' t warn a suspect who' s under investigation . That' s what Adam is now , a suspect ? You need to call Sid Kroll . I think we should call London first . Adam ! If it suits them , they will hang you out to dry .\par
You need a lawyer . Call Sid . - Get Sid on the line . - What about the media ? Issue a holding statement , something short . This is when we need Mike . I' il write something . Let him do it . He' s supposed to be the writer . - Hang on a minute .\par
I should sound confident . Not defensive , that' d be fatal . But I shouldn' t be cocky . No bitterness , no anger , and don' t say I' m pleased at this opportunity to clear my name or any balls like that . So , you' re not defensive , but you' re not cocky . You' re not angry , but you' re not pleased ? That' s it . - Then what exactly are you ? Told you he was funny .\par
I' ve always been a passionate supporter ... No , scrub that . I' ve always been a strong , no , committed supporter of the work of the InternationaI CriminaI Court . You' re the writer . The struggle against terror is too important to be used for the purposes of personaI revenge . Very good . You could be the new Mike McAra . - Hello ? John Maddox . This is gonna be big .\par
This can only be good for us . - Could be . - Here' s the first chapter right here . Okay . What' ve you covered so far ? Um ... The early years , childhood , university . All right , forget that crap . Get him focused on the war crimes . And he can' t talk to anybody else , all right ?\par
- Right . - It' s gotta be our exclusive . Any chance of you finishing the manuscript sooner ? Sooner ? Yeah , yeah , sooner . Well , how much sooner ? I' m thinking two weeks . Jesus . Look , I know it' s tough , but if anyone can do it , you can . I' m relying on you .\par
We' il talk . Shit . I' d never have guessed you smoked . I only allow myself one at times of great stress or contentment . - And which is this ? - Very funny . Maddox just called . He wants the book in two weeks instead of four . Christ . Good luck .\par
Yeah , I wouldn' t mind a lift back to my hotel . I could get on with some work there . You' re not planning on taking that manuscript - out of here , are you ? - Course not . Because you do realize how serious this is getting , don' t you ? - You can search me , if you like . - That won' t be necessary . All right . Fetch your stuff .\par
I' il get one of the boys to take you . Mr. Lang insisted he had always been a committed supporter of the work of the InternationaI CriminaI Court . Mr. Lang added , quote , " The struggle against terror is too important " to be used for the purposes of personaI revenge . " - Same again , sir ? - This is being widely interpreted as ... - Yes , thanks . - ... an attack on the former British Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart , who has asked ... Could we change the channel ?\par
- Sure . - Thanks . At issue is the practice of so- called waterboarding , an interrogation technique considered a war ... - Something to eat ? - What' ve you got ? - Club sandwich . Clam chowder . - Chowder will be fine . You' re English ? And so are you .\par
Indeed I am . - You here on a holiday ? - No , I' m working . So , what' s your line ? Just this and that . Excuse me . I hear Adam Lang' s on the island . Is he ? So I hear . You don' t happen to know his whereabouts , do you ?\par
No . No , I' m afraid not . If you don' t mind . Raymond to Naslund and to Mattias Ohlund . A slap pass to Lukas Krajicek . He' s in trouble against Barret Jackman and the referee ... Asshole . ... and Ohlund can' t hold it in again , and this power play is just about over . Keith Tkachuk almost set to come back on . Hello ?\par
- Can I help you ? - Hi . Yeah , can you tell me , has anyone gone up to my room ? No , sir . - Did anyone ask for me ? - No . What about that other guest ? The , um ... There' s an Englishman . You' re the only guest in the hotel , sir .\par
- Hello ? You need to check out of the hoteI immediately . Things have changed . A car is on its way . What ? See you then . Hello ? Okay . - Just check on that . Okay ?\par
- It' s getting big , huh ? - So I see . Who' re you with ? I' m on my own . Oh , sod it . Here we go again . You' ve reached the office of Rick Ricardelli . Leave a message . Hi , Rick . Now they want the book in two weeks .\par
Thanks for getting me this job . Can' t talk . Some peace protestors are trying to kill me . You' re working for a murderer ! You' re working for a murderer ! Liar ! Liar ! Liar ! - Are you ill ? - No , I' m aging .\par
This place is Shangri- La in reverse . I tried to call you severaI times last night . You didn' t answer . I forgot to charge my mobile phone . Really ? And the hoteI phone ? I' m a heavy sleeper . Well , you can do your heavy sleeping here from now on . - Here ? We' re under siege .\par
You can' t run the media gauntlet every day . Eventually , they' il discover who you are . And that would be horrid for you . So , this is where you put the granny . No . This is where we put Mike McAra . We haven' t had a chance to clear it yet . The sheets have been changed , though . Actually , I make it a rule never to stay in a client' s house . But now you can have constant access to the manuscript .\par
Isn' t that what you want ? Besides , Sid Kroll will be arriving any minute . Why don' t you settle in , and then come up and join us ? - You' re practically one of us now . - I am ? You drafted the statement yesterday . That makes you an accomplice . So , here' s the score . You' re not being charged , you' re not being arrested . None of this is gonna amount to a hill of beans .\par
The only thing the prosecutor is asking for is permission to launch a formaI investigation . - Investigating me for what ? - Connie ? Either crimes against humanity or war crimes . Well , that' s absurd . It' s not exactly genocide . " Under Article 25 , a person shall be guilty of a war crime " if that person facilitates the commission of such a crime " or aids , abets or otherwise assists in its commission . " - That' s rather sweeping .\par
- Well , if it' s any comfort , you' re in no jeopardy as long as you stay here , among friends . Are you saying I can' t leave the United States ? As your attorney , I strongly advise you not to traveI to any country that recognizes the jurisdiction of the InternationaI CriminaI Court . Well , just about every country in the world recognizes the ICC . America doesn' t . - Who else ? Josh ? Iraq , China , North Korea , Indonesia , Israel . - And that' s it ? There are some parts of Africa .\par
Wait ! I wish to make a short statement . I won' t be taking questions . This morning , I was granted power to investigate the former British Prime Minister , Mr. Adam Peter Bennett Lang , under Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the InternationaI CriminaI Court . I shall shortly be contacting Mr. Lang and the British government to ask for their full cooperation . Oh , God . Okay , we need to get you to Washington , Adam , right away . My plane is at the airport . We can get you in to see the Speaker of the House at lunchtime and have a photo- op with the Secretary of State in the afternoon . Won' t it look as if I' m panicking ?\par
No , they' il both say that the meetings were fixed weeks ago . Well , what the hell are we supposed to be discussing ? AlDS ? Poverty ? Climate change ? Who cares ? The important thing is to show the world it' s business as usual . - What do you think , Ruth ? - I think it' s a terrible idea . You' II look as though you' re America' s whipping boy , running crying home to daddy .\par
- So , what would you do ? Fly to London . The government will support you . " The British government will cooperate fully with the investigation . " Really ? And what makes you think that ? I' m not thinking it , Ruth , I' m reading it . ... believe we can now go live to the UN in New York , where the former British Foreign Secretary , Richard Rycart , is about to make a statement . I watched the announcement in The Hague today with great shock and sadness . Adam Lang was and is an old friend of mine . You cheeky bugger !\par
I regret that he' s chosen to bring this down to a personaI level . This isn' t personal . This is about justice . This is about making sure every politicaI leader knows when they make a decision , they will be held to account by internationaI law . Thank you . If you' re called to testify , sir , will you go ? Certainly , I' il go . - Of course you will , you little shit ! That settles it . Washington it is .\par
I still say it' II look bad . Not as bad as being led away from Heathrow in handcuffs . It would show you had some guts . Well , then why the hell don' t you just fly back without me ? If the British government wants to hand me over to this kangaroo court , then sod them ! I' il go where people want me . Amelia , tell the boys we' re leaving . Have one of the girls pack me a bag . You' d better pack one for yourself . Why don' t you share a suitcase ?\par
It' s so much more convenient . I' il see you tomorrow . I' m sorry to abandon you . At least this might help sales . Perhaps Rhinehart' s PR department organized the whole thing . Well , tell them to stop it , will you ? Okay , people , remember , happy , happy faces . So , just to summarize what we know so far , it' s now official , the speciaI prosecutor of the InternationaI War Crimes Court is to launch an investigation ... ... the speciaI prosecutor announced she was going to investigate Mr. Lang , well , there was a big cheer , I can tell you . So , let' s talk to some of these protestors .\par
- You , sir , you' re English , I believe . - I am . So , what brings you so far from home ? My son . He was killed in one of Mr. Lang' s illegaI wars . Lang' s never visited the injured . He' s never apologized . I was in the British Army for 30 years . It' s a disgrace ! Thank you .\par
Can I ask you the same question ? You' re a murderer , Lang ! You' re a war criminal ! Liar , liar , liar ! Lang , Lang , Lang ! Killer , killer , killer ! Lang , Lang , Lang ! Liar , liar , liar ! Lang , Lang , Lang ! Killer , killer , killer !\par
Over here , Mr. Lang ! I apologize for keeping you waiting so long in the cold . What' s your reaction to Mr. Rycart' s statement ? I' d like to say a few words in response to the news from The Hague . These are strange times when those who stand for freedom and justice are accused of being criminals , while those who incite hatred and seek to destroy democracy - are treated as victims . War criminal ! Let me make one thing perfectly clear . While I have breath in my body , I shall fight terrorism ... Liar ! ... whether it' s on the battlefield or , if necessary , in the courts .\par
Thank you very much . Have you spoken to the President , Mr. Lang ? Oh , for God' s sake . God . Shit ! One minute ! Yes ? Sir ? You want lunch ? That would be great .\par
Give me five minutes , thanks . P. Emmett ? Richard Rycart . Who is this ? - Dep ? - Sir ? Is there a map of the island that I could borrow ? Look . It' s rain soon . I don' t know .\par
I think it will be all right . Why don' t you take the car ? It' s for guests . Here' s the key . - For our guests , it' s very nice car . - Oh . Yes . Mr. McAra loved this car very , very much . Do you know ... I' m gonna take the ...\par
I' m gonna take the bicycle . Thanks . This is ... Just a moment , just a moment . It' s rain . I give ... I give you my hat and my gloves . - That' s very kind , thank you . - Good luck for you . - Thank you .\par
Thank you , yeah , bye . - Bye- bye . Just one moment . God , you frightened me . - You' re British . - I am , yeah . It' s okay , you can shelter . Sheltering' s free . No , no , no , no ! Rosie , Rosie !\par
In you go . In , in . Here . - So , you' re British , huh ? - Yeah . - You anything to do with this fellow , Lang ? - In a way , yes . Seems intelligent . Now why did he go and get himself mixed up with that damn fooI in the White House ? Well , that' s what everyone wants to know .\par
What brings you to this part of the island ? I' m sightseeing . Well , you sure picked a heck of a day for it . Someone I knew was found washed up on the beach there . - You mean the British guy from the ferry ? - That' s right . - Now that was a funny business . - What do you mean ? No way should that current have carried him that far west . - No ?\par
- No way ! Are you sure ? I' ve lived here 54 years . Did you mention that to the police ? The police ? At my age , I' ve better things to do , young man . Annabeth' s the one dealing with the police . Your wife ? Annabeth Wurmbrand , Mars Wurmbrand' s widow . She' s the one who told them about the lights .\par
- Lights ? - The flashlights on the beach . - When ? - The night the body was washed up . Could , could you , um ... Could you point me in the direction of Mrs. Wurmbrand' s house ? Oh , sure . You just ... Here . Follow it down the beach there .\par
It' s the house nearest the ocean . But she won' t talk to you . - Why not ? - She' s in a coma . Fell down stairs a week ago . Been in a coma ever since . Come down ! Come down ! Dep told me you were here ! What ?\par
I said Dep told me you were here . We came to get you before the storm came . What are you doing ? - Just taking the air . - No , really . I wanted to see where Mike McAra was found . Why ? Adam' s asked me to write something about him in the book . - Where' s your bike ? - Up there .\par
Barry , will you come around with the car ? We' il meet you out by the road . I can' t do that , I' m afraid , Mrs. Lang . Have to stay with you at all times . For God' s sake ! If we meet any terrorists , I' il text you . All right , well , stay on the path . Don' t speak to anyone . We won' t talk to a soul , Officer , I promise . Poor Mike .\par
I can' t bear the idea of him ending up so far from home . I wonder if we' il ever know whether it was accident or suicide . Can' t help you . I never met him . I suppose it doesn' t really matter . He was drunk . He drowned . End of story . - What was he doing on the ferry ? - No idea .\par
Funeral' s on Monday , in London . I' m thinking of going . One of us should put in an appearance , and it doesn' t seem likely to be my husband . I thought you didn' t want to leave him . Rather seems as though he' s left me , wouldn' t you say ? - Hello ? - Sorry . I did knock . It' s just me . - I brought you some dry clothes .\par
- That' s all right . I can manage . Dinner' s in an hour , okay ? Fine , thanks . For God' s sake . " It was at the time of the London elections " that I first got to know Ruth . " She had gained a First at Oxford " and then done a year' s postgraduate research as a Fulbright scholar . " Ruth .\par
- Perfect fit . Now all you need is a drink . - What are we having ? Biodynamic white wine from the Rhinehart Vinery in the Napa Valley . Rhinehart . He doesn' t own a distillery , I suppose ? Mmm . Evening news . ... for war crimes . Our politicaI editor has more .\par
Christ , we' re the lead story . Pour us some more wine , will you ? I may have to get drunk for a change . In Washington , Mr. Lang received firm promises of support , both from congressionaI leaders and the Secretary of State , before going on to a private dinner tonight with the Vice President . Adam Lang has stood by America' s side in the war against terror , and I' m proud to stand by his side this afternoon . - Adam , good to see you . Thank you . Thank you very much , indeed . It' s good to see you . Don' t grin .\par
In Iraq , a suicide bomber ... For God' s sake ! Adam . Calling to find out how I think it went . - Let him sweat . - Does he always ask for your advice ? Yes , and always usually takes it . UntiI lately . - Are you married ? - Certainly not .\par
- Gay ? - No . - Did you have a ... - I had a ... Um ... - What ? Girlfriend ? - Well , a bit more than that . Partner ? A bit less than that .\par
I don' t know , 40, 000 years of human language and there' s no word to describe our relationship . It was doomed . Come on . Let' s eat . - How' s it going ? - The book ? - Well , it' s not , to be honest . - Sit there . - Can I ask you something ? - Of course .\par
I find it difficult to understand certain things . - What things ? - Well ... I can' t understand why this good- looking lad who goes to Cambridge without the slightest interest in politics and who spends his time acting and chasing girls , - suddenly ends up ... - Married to me ? Oh , no , not that . No , not that , at all . No , what I don' t get is why , at 22 , he' s suddenly a politicaI activist . - I mean , where does that come from ?\par
- Didn' t you ask him ? He said he joined the party because of you . Told me a great story about you turning up at his place in the rain . - I was gonna start the whole book with it . - And now you' re not ? No , I can' t . It' s not true . - Isn' t it ? - Well , you know it' s not . He' d been a member for two years before he met you .\par
How do you know that ? I' ve got a copy of his originaI party membership card . Mike McAra found it in the archives . TypicaI Mike , to ruin a good story with too much research . Did he find anything else ? Not much . Cambridge stuff mainly . You were more politicaI than he was . I was certainly a change from his Cambridge girlfriends . All those Jocastas and Pandoras .\par
And so his marriage to you must have been pretty vital , your knowledge and your contacts in the party . And I thought he married me for my body . Did you ever want to be a proper politician in your own right ? Of course . Didn' t you want to be a proper writer ? Ouch . I' m sorry . I' ve hurt your feelings . I suppose even ghosts must have feelings . We are sensitive spirits .\par
Talking of spirits , could you ... Let me get you a proper drink . White wine , never really seen the point of it . That' s the sort of thing Mike used to say . Ah ! At last , something in common . Do you know the coroner reckoned he' d drunk nearly half a bottle ? That' s convenient . - What do you mean ? - Nothing .\par
- You think his death was suspicious ? - Don' t you ? Yes . Yes , I do . Today at the beach , I met a man , an old timer who was familiar with the currents . And he said that there was no way that a body from the ferry could have washed ashore on that spot . You' re kidding . He also said that there was a woman who saw flashlights on the beach that night . And then she fell down the stairs , and now she' s in a coma .\par
That' s all I know . That' s all you know ? Jesus . - Can I borrow your phone ? - Why ? I need to call Adam . - What ? - Nothing . - Aren' t you gonna call him ? - Later .\par
I' m going out for a walk . But it' s pitch black . It' s pouring with rain . - It' il clear my head . - Well , I' il come with you . No . Thanks , but I need to work this one through on my own . Stay here . Have another drink . Don' t wait up .\par
Are you awake ? - Well , I am now . - I' m sorry . It' s all right . Hang on . - What time is it ? - I don' t know . I called Adam . - And ? - Can I come in ?\par
The day before Mike died , he and Adam had a terrible row . I' ve never told anyone this before , not even the police . - What about ? - I don' t know . But it was furious . They never spoke again . When I asked Adam about it , he refused to discuss it . After what you just said , I felt I should ask him again . And what did he say ? He was having dinner with the Vice President .\par
That bloody Bly woman wouldn' t even give him the phone . Oh , God . Oh , dear God . What' s he got himself mixed up in ? It' s all right . Everything' il be all right . I' m scared . I' ve never been scared in my life before , but I am now . Your hair' s all wet , you' re drenched . Let me get you a towel .\par
Bad idea . Do you mind ? Course not . The modesty of the morning after ? I' m sorry . I thought you were asleep . You mean you thought I' d be gone ? You' ve taken out the family tree . He' s very proud of the Langs . You know , if you want a family tree , go to a garden center .\par
Why have you underlined my name every time ? I was surprised there wasn' t more about you . Why ? I' m just the wife . Yeah , even so . You ought not to be written out of history . Why not ? Most women are . Then I' il reinstate you . I' il put in all the occasions that he' s forgotten .\par
How kind . Like the boss' s secretary that remembers his wife' s birthday for him ? Something like that . But then , like you say , I' m not a proper writer . - What are you planning to do ? - Leave . It' s not necessary , as far as I' m concerned . I' m afraid it is , as far as I am . - Where will you go ? - Back to the hotel .\par
Look , I' m sorry . I should never have stayed in a client' s house . - It always ends up with ... - With you screwing the client' s wife ? No , not always . But it does make it hard to maintain a professionaI distance . And the thing we discussed last night ? What do you propose to do about that ? - That' s none of my business . - Well , you can' t just ignore it .\par
Look , I' m his ghostwriter . I' m not an investigative reporter . - What are you gonna do about it ? - Perhaps I' il write my own memoirs . Ex- Prime Minister' s Wife Tells AIl . Well , if you ever decide to do that , give me a call . You think I need someone like you to produce my book ? I don' t want to be in his bloody memoirs . He' s on his own . I' il get a divorce .\par
And she can do the prison visits . Morning , sir . - Finished for the night , have we ? - Why don' t you just piss off ? BMW ConnectedDrive . Traffic is clear to your destination . Join the road when possible . In 200 yards , turn left . Sorry , lady , but the hoteI is right . Turn around when possible .\par
This is getting ridiculous . Turn around when possible . All right , you win . In 50 yards , turn left . Turn left . You' ve got to be joking . Single or return ? Return . I hope . Forty bucks , please .\par
- Have a good one . - Ta . Okay , come on . Come on , keep coming . A little more . Stop . In 50 yards , turn left . Please proceed to the indicated road . In 200 yards , take the next exit . In half a mile , make a sharp right turn .\par
Turn left . In 200 yards , you will have reached your destination . You have reached your destination . PauI Emmett ? Professor PauI Emmett ? " Professor PauI Emmett of Harvard University " has written of the unique importance of the English- speaking peoples " in the spread of democracy around the world . " As these nations stand together , " whenever they have faltered , tyranny has gathered strength . "\par
Hello ? - Is that Mrs. Emmett ? - Who is this ? I wondered if I might have a word with Professor Emmett . Do you have an appointment ? It' s about Adam Lang . I' m assisting him with his memoirs . Just a moment , please . This is PauI Emmett . I think you must have made a mistake .\par
But you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang ? We were contemporaries , yes , but I can' t claim to know him . I have a photograph of you together . Come on up to the house . I make it a rule never to see anyone without an appointment . But your mention of a photograph rather tickled my curiosity . - Please , come in . - Thank you . Yes , he' s here now . - May I ?\par
- Sure . Yes . Yes , he' s on his own . He didn' t say . British , about 40 . Well , well . I literally have no recollection of this . - But that is you ? - Yes , it is . I was on the board of the Dramat .\par
I had quite a time of it , as you can imagine . - The Dramat ? - I' m sorry . The Yale Dramatic Association . I maintained my theatricaI interests when I went to Cambridge for my doctoraI research . - Could I keep this ? - No , I' m afraid not . - I' m sure I could get you a copy . - Would you ? That would be kind .\par
Maybe you could tell me how you came by it . I' d be happy to . Come into my study . Yes , the wall of ego . We all have one . It' s our equivalent of the dentist' s fish tank . Have a seat . So , the picture . Um ... I' ve been working with Adam Lang on his memoirs .\par
Yes , I know , you told me . Yes , poor Lang . It' s bad business , this posturing by The Hague . As for Rycart , the worst British Foreign Secretary since the war . Lang was right to fire him . - How well do you know Lang ? - Hardly at all . - You seem surprised . - He mentions you in his memoirs . Oh , really ?\par
Well , now it' s my turn to be surprised . What does he say ? That' s very decent of him . As Prime Minister , he always had good instincts . - But that doesn' t mean I know him . - But the ... That . That was taken at a reception in London to mark the 10- year anniversary of the Arcadia . - Arcadia ? - Yeah , it' s a little organization that I ran .\par
Very highbrow . No reason why you should have heard of it . The Prime Minister graced us with his presence . What can you remember of him from Cambridge ? - I' m sorry , you don' t mind , do you ? - No , not at all . Go ahead . It' s just that I' m rather bewildered . No one' s mentioned the Cambridge connection between us in all these years . - But you performed together ?\par
- In one production . It was the summer revue . I can' t even remember what it was called . - Can I show you something else ? - If you must . Oh , my . Is that what I think it is ? Let' s hope he didn' t inhale . But that is you standing behind him , isn' t it ? I do believe it is .\par
And I do believe I' m on the point of issuing a stern warning to him on the perils of drug abuse . Is Mr. Lang really going to use these pictures in his memoirs ? If so , I would prefer it if I weren' t named . My children would be mortified . They' re so much more puritanicaI than we were . - Can you tell me about any of the others ? - No , I' m afraid not . The whole summer is a blur , a very happy blur . Now , you were going to tell me about these pictures . I got them from MichaeI McAra .\par
And he is whom , exactly ? My predecessor on Lang' s memoirs . - He resigned ? - No , he died . I' m sorry to hear that . Yes , a couple of weeks ago . He drove up here to see you . And he died a few hours afterwards . He drove up to see me ? No , I' m afraid you' re mistaken .\par
- How did he die ? - He drowned . Poor fellow . I' ve never really believed the myth that death by drowning is painless , have you ? Seems to me it must be agonizing . And the police never said anything to you about this ? I' ve had no contact with the police . But were you here that weekend ? This would have been January , the 11th and 12th . A less equable man than I might start to find your questions impertinent .\par
Nancy ? Nancy ? Our visitor wishes to know where we were on the 11th and 12th of January . Do we possess that information ? That was the Colorado weekend . Yes , of course , the Aspen Institute . Bipolar relationships in a multi- polar world . - Sounds fun . - Yes , it was . I was the main speaker .\par
Look , just to return to Cambridge ... No , if you don' t mind , let' s not return to Cambridge . I' ve said all I have to say on that subject . I' m an avid reader of politicaI memoirs . I' il get hold of Mr. Lang' s when they appear . Perhaps he' il send you a copy , for old time' s sake . I doubt that very much . The gate will open automatically . Be sure to make a right when you get to the end of the drive . If you turn left , the road will take you deeper into the woods and you may never be seen again .\par
When is the last ferry ? - You' re just in time . - Here , I' ve got a return . All right . Ticket ? - Uh ... - Okay . - Okay . Shit . Hey , you !\par
Stop ! Don' t do that ! Where you going ? Shit ! You' ve reached the office of Rick Ricardelli . Leave a message . Piss off . What can I do for you , sir ? You wouldn' t happen to know if there are any flights leaving the airport tonight , would you ? Not unless you' ve got your own private jet .\par
I lent it to my butler . You Brits ! There' s a flight to Boston - 8 : 30 tomorrow morning . - Shit ! - How much for a room ? - For you , $89 . - I' il pay cash . - Who' s got your card ? The nanny ?\par
You rang back . Are you going to stay on the line this time ? Yes . I' ve been trying to call you . I know , I' m sorry ... It didn' t seem right , speaking to you . Who are you ? I' m the new ghostwriter ... No names , don' t use any names . How did you get this number ?\par
It was in my predecessor' s effects . The ... The thing is , I' m in trouble . Is it because of your client ? Yeah . There' s something wrong , but I didn' t know who to talk to . Where are you ? Without being too specific . On the island ? I' m in the ...\par
No , I' m on the mainland , on the ... This moteI by the ferry . Room number ? 201 . - Have you got the book with you ? - Yeah . Okay . Stay there . Hatherton ? With $35 billion of funds at its disposal , the Hatherton Group brings together a family of companies devoted to defense and security .\par
And with unrivaled expertise in the Middle East , including the services of two former Presidents , three Prime Ministers and two directors of the ClA , Hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront of the struggle against terror . Hatherton , a shelter from harm . " According to ClA whistleblower Frank Molinari , " Yale graduate PauI Emmett " was reported to have joined the Agency as an officer in 1971 , It' s 1974 . - Hello ? You' re alive . Yeah , just about .\par
I' ve been worried sick . The police called to say they' d found the car on the ferry . Again ! I' m so sorry . I parked it , and then , and then I got off the boat . What the hell were you doing on the mainland , anyway ? - I drove to New York . - Why ? I needed to see John Maddox . And where are you now ?\par
I' m still at the ferry terminal . I missed the last crossing . You really are bloody hopeless ! I just had Adam on the phone , trying to get hold of you . He' s flying back tonight . He sounds in a right state . You didn' t tell him about us , did you ? God' s sake , Ruth ! I' ve got to go . I' il call you back .\par
- Who is it ? - Mr. Rycart sent me . Hold on . Just gonna do a quick check , if you don' t mind . Get your stuff together . We' re leaving . Hey ! That' s private ! - He' s clean . Thanks , Frank .\par
Sorry about that . Please , get in . - You thought it was a trap ? - It crossed my mind . You do work for Lang . Yeah , for three days . I hardly know the guy . Who does ? I worked for him for 15 years , till he fired me , and I still can' t fathom him . Yeah , his wife said more or less the same .\par
There you go . If someone as sharp as Ruth can' t get him , what hope do we have ? - Tough day ? - Yeah , you could say that . You have the book ? Yeah . He' s got it . Before we go any further , I wonder if I might take a look at that book . No . Before we go any further , there' s a few things I' d like to know first .\par
Such as , why did Mike McAra have your number ? Okay . Sure . He was helping me . McAra ? How ? Mike found the documents linking Lang to the torture flights . What ? It was McAra who gave you the documents ? - Yeah , Mike McAra .\par
The loyalest of the loyal . - But why ? He didn' t like discovering he was working for a war criminal . Would you ? Oh , I forgot . You are . The book ? Well , don' t tell me you' re gonna read it now . Not all of it . Just the beginning .\par
There' s something very important about it . Yeah . It' s the cure for insomnia . There you go , guys . Can I get you anything else ? No , thanks , love . Mike said he' d discovered something new . It' s the last time he called me . He said it explained everything that had gone wrong when we were in government . - What was it ?\par
- He wouldn' t say over the phone . He just kept saying if anything happened to him , the truth was in Lang' s memoirs . " It' s all there in the beginning . " The beginning ? Then he means Cambridge . What the hell' s this ? That is Lang , and that is PauI Emmett . Emmett ? The Arcadia guy . So what ?\par
On the day that Mike McAra died , he drove up to see Emmett , and I think he was murdered on his way home . - What ? - I went to see Emmett today , and two guys followed me from his house . That' s why I called you . At the time that this photograph was taken , PauI Emmett was an officer in the ClA . Emmett ? - Foreign Resources Division . - Oh , my God . You realize how important this is , don' t you ?\par
This explains why Lang went into politics . Everyone knows he didn' t have a politicaI thought in his pretty little head . This is why he rose so quickly , with a little help from his friends . - Well , do you think it' s possible ... - Okay , a quiz for you . Name one decision Lang made in 10 years as Prime Minister which wasn' t in the interests of the USA . Well , come on , it' s not a trick question . Iraq , Middle East policy , Star Wars defense , buying American nuclear missiles , support of terrorist rendition . The sacking of any minister Washington didn' t like , including yours truly . McAra was right .\par
This explains everything . It' s Amelia Bly . Answer it . - Hello , Amelia . - Good evening . I have Adam for you . Lang . We' re coming to get you . What ? Ruth tells me you' re stuck at the ferry terminal .\par
We' ve just taken off from New York . Pilot says we can stop by and pick you up . Really ? There' s no need . We' ve got a book to write , remember ? Hold on a sec , Adam . He said he wants to pick me up in his private jet . - Say yes . - What if it' s a trap ? If you refuse , he' il get suspicious .\par
Tell him yes . That' d be great , Adam . Yeah , thanks . I' il get to the airport . See you there . He sounds worried . I really don' t think this is a good idea . You have no choice . Emmett must have told Lang that I' d been to see him . So , what' s he gonna do about it ?\par
Dump you in the ocean ? - Well , it happened before ! - Which means it can' t happen again . He can' t drown two ghostwriters , for God' s sake . You' re not kittens . All this is just theory . We don' t have any proof . - You' il get us the proof . - Me ? You' re his ghostwriter .\par
Presumably , he lets you tape him . - I use discs , actually . - Discs , tapes . You' ve got to confront him with this . Record his reaction . Even if he denies it , it' s something . I' m in a tricky position here . I signed a confidentiality agreement . It' s a bit late for that . - It means the discs are his property .\par
- The court can subpoena them . And what if I don' t record any discs ? Then you' il be subpoenaed and forced to repeat this whole story . Then I' il deny it . Then I' il give them this . Frank is recording every word . Aren' t you , Frank ? Oh ! Come on ! Don' t look so shocked .\par
What did you expect ? That I' d come into a meeting with a man working for Lang without taking any precautions ? Except you' re not working for Lang anymore . You' re working for the good guys . You know all this is pointless , don' t you ? In the end , he' il just retire over here with his ClA pension , and he' il tell you and the bloody war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves . Good evening , sir . Hatherton welcomes you aboard . Thank you . It' s my first time in a private jet .\par
Well , let' s hope it' s not your last . Hi , man . - Take your seat . - Thanks . - Hey , bring my ghost a Calvados . - Yes , sir . Do you mind ? Leave it off for now . Ruth said you were in New York to see Maddox . - That' s right .\par
- How was he ? He was fine . Full of energy ? - You know John . - Yes , I do know John . As a matter of fact , I was just with him . You never saw him today , did you ? No . Do you have something to tell me ? I went to see Emmett .\par
That windbag ! Why ? I know about you and Emmett . - Me and Emmett ? - I know that he was your ... - My ? - ... handler , if that' s what they' re called . - My handler ? - Yeah , that he was your handler in the ClA . Oh , my God . You' re serious , aren' t you ?\par
When McAra found this , he went to Boston to show it to Emmett , and he died on the way home , and I think he was murdered . I think you' ve had a few too many of those already . It was McAra who believed that Emmett told you to go into politics in the first place . - Emmett ? I barely knew the man . - And that story of yours about why you joined the party and Ruth and the canvassing , well , the dates don' t fit . I got the dates wrong . Big deal ! Then when he found this photograph , and he heard the rumors about Emmett being in the ClA ... - Rumors ?\par
- It' s on the Internet . I' ve never heard such utter balls in my entire life . Mike would never have believed such crap . He was too clever . Too loyal . Mike betrayed you to Rycart . - How do you know that ? - He told me . Rycart ? He' s Iying .\par
This phone number on the back of the photograph , it' s Rycart' s . The handwriting , that' s McAra' s . Mike . - Mike , Mike . - And you knew he was disillusioned . You had a big row with him just before he died . Yes , I know , but he never mentioned this . This is just ... This is grotesque . I' ve never taken orders from anyone .\par
Whatever I did , I did because I believed it was right . What , even supporting illegaI kidnapping for torture ? Oh , for God' s sake , spare me the bleeding- heart bullshit ! Do you know what I' d do if I was in power again ? I' d have two queues at airports . One for flights where we' d done no background checks , infringed on no one' s civiI bloody liberties , used no intelligence gained by torture . And on the other flight , we' d do everything we possibly could to make it perfectly safe . And then we' d see which plane the Rycarts of this world would put their bloody kids on ! And you can put that in the book ! Go home !\par
Go home ! Here comes the killer ! Prosecute for torture ! Over here , Mr. Lang ! Mr. Lang ! Mr. Lang , will you live in America ? Mr. Lang , will you take American citizenship ? When we get back to the house , we need to have a meeting . Oh , my God ! - Murderer !\par
Firing from the roof ! Let me go to him ! No ! No ! Move , move , move ! How long had you known Mr. Lang ? - Couple of days . - In what capacity ? I was his ghost . His ghostwriter .\par
Do you recognize this man ? He was one of the protestors . His son was killed in Iraq . Did you ever speak with him ? He was in the bar one night in the hoteI where I was staying . But did you speak with him ? He asked me if I knew where Adam Lang was staying on the island . - I told him that I didn' t . - Did you report this conversation ? Sorry ?\par
Did you report this conversation to Mr. Lang' s protection team ? No . What was Mr. Lang' s demeanor this evening ? He was ... He was fine . He seemed fine . One witness said she thought she heard Mr. Lang shouting at you . No . - We' re gonna need your passport . A serious crime was just committed in US territory , and you' re the key witness .\par
We need to keep you close . Like a fallen soldier , Adam Lang went home today , home to a shocked and grieving nation . Not just his family , but friends and politicaI opponents joined in tribute . A great colleague and a true patriot . We had our disagreements , but we always stayed friends . My heart goes out to Ruth and the family . And I would like to say Adam will be ... Who is it ? Congratulations ! On what now ?\par
Still having me as your agent . Hmm ? They don' t need you anymore . You' re free to go . - You ready to get back to work ? - I don' t think I can , Rick . - I' m sorry . Not after all this . - Don' t be a jerk . This is a hot book now .\par
It' s Adam Lang' s voice from the grave . - The guy , he' s a hero . - I just want to go home . You can . Go . Go home . And finish the book from London . I don' t know , Rick . Here we are . Oh , here we are .\par
I' m sorry . I think I' m over it , and then suddenly I realize I' m not . - Are you sure this is all right ? - Of course . My invitation said plus one . Only I wondered if you might' ve wanted to bring your husband . That didn' t work out . I hadn' t appreciated quite how bored he was with being my plus one . - Shall we go in ? - Yeah .\par
- Amelia Bly , plus one . - Thank you . That was a bit of a turn- up , for the books , you calling me . I heard you weren' t invited , and I thought you should be here . Ghosts are never invited to the launch party , as a rule . We' re an embarrassment . Like a mistress at a wedding . Sorry . I brought you a present . Thank you .\par
That' s very funny . I thought , seeing as you were so keen to hold onto it , you might like it as a souvenir . Between you and me , it wasn' t us , it was the Americans . They thought the book was a potentiaI threat to nationaI security . But there' s nothing in it . Something about the beginnings . I think that' s what I heard . - The beginning ? - No , beginnings . The beginnings .\par
Beginnings ? You all right ? Do you know that man ? The one who' s speaking to Ruth . - PauI Emmett ? - What' s he doing here ? Well , he was Ruth' s tutor at Harvard when she was a Fulbright scholar . Why shouldn' t he be here ? Do you mind if I have that back a second ? Madam ?\par
No , thank you . " Langs are Scottish folk , originally . " " Wife and child in tow , I decided to ... " I decided to settle . " Ladies and gentlemen , if I could have your attention , please . Thank you . I' d like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words . I miss Adam all the time . But never more than tonight . Not just ' cause we' re meeting to launch his wonderfuI new book and he should be here to share the joy of his life story with us , but because he was so brilliant at making speeches and I' m so terrible .\par
" Langs are Scottish folk . " " Wife and child , Langs are Scottish . " " Wife , Langs . Lang' s wife . " " Lang' s " wife Ruth " was recruited " as a ClA agent " by Professor PauI Emmett of Harvard University . " Well , you' il be relieved to hear I' m not making a speech this evening . I just want to thank our wonderfuI publishers , Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox , and our attorney and friend , Sidney Kroll . And finally , but especially , Mike McAra .\par
Mike , our thoughts are with you . In these very difficult few months , I' ve drawn great comfort from this book , from knowing that , despite the terrible double tragedy of losing both of them , Mike and Adam did at least live long enough to complete it . And I really believe that , as people read these pages , Adam' s voice will keep on coming through for generations to come , eloquent , strong and full of hope . Thanks to his words , he is with us still . If I' ve left out anyone' s name , I hope you' il forgive me . But now I must make a toast . To the memory of a great man and a great patriot , a wonderfuI husband and a devoted father . To Adam !\par
To Adam ! You were marvelous . Would you ... This one looks nasty . Yeah , it' s just happened just now . Yeah , if you could . What am I gonna do ? Oh , shit . You have to get it now ? Why does everything happen to you first ?\par
Here , take these . You took Ma' s heels ? Like she' s ever worn anything twice . Besides , you should be more worried about her finding out ... - ... how old your skanky boyfriend is . - Does your boyfriend have a car ? I' m sorry , do you even have a boyfriend ? Maybe I don' t want a boyfriend . No way . Nice .\par
You' re officially a woman . Let' s fucking celebrate . Derek , did Marie tell you that she' s not wearing any underwear ? Really ? I hope that runs in the family . Are you just gonna hang around ... . .. or are you actually gonna buy something this time ? Hey , honey , you' re looking in the wrong section . The Women' s section is on the other side . I want what he' s wearing . Oh , dude .\par
- Who am l ? - Elvis . No , man . I' m the fucking Glycerine Queen . Suzi Quatro . - I' m the fucking wild one . - Yeah ! Mom' s gonna kill you . - It really looks terrible . - Good .\par
Crap . Here , let me help you . Fuck . My brother says that guys don' t like girls that are tough . He says guys like girls that are soft and flirty . Yeah , he would say that . He' s a pussy . He does spend a lot of time doing his bangs . Next contestant , from Mrs. Morgan' s 10th grade class ... . .. Cherie Currie performing " Lady Grinning Soul . " Nice pants !\par
Yeah ! - Sit down . - Love you , Cherie ! You suck . - I love it ! - Freak . You go , Cherie ! We love you ! Stay up there , Cherie ! Sit down now , please .\par
- Cherie ! - She' s going off . Just keep working on those scales . - I' il see you next week . - Okay . See you . Joan Larkin . It' s Jett . Joan Jett . Come on in , Joan Jett .\par
All right . Here . Okay . Well , let' s get started . - So what kind of amps you guys got ? - Amps ? Well , why don' t we just keep it unplugged for now , okay ? All right . A -- Well , I wanna play , like , Chuck Berry , you know , " Johnny B. Goode " ?\par
Why don' t we just start with a G chord ? A G chord to a C , to a D. How' s that ? G chord , like that . On top of Old Smokey All covered with snow Now we' re gonna go to a D. I lost my poor sweetheart To the G. From courting too slow\par
- You see that ? Did you see -- ? - " Old Smokey " ? That one' s goofy , man . I mean , at least teach me " Smoke on the Water . " I know you know that one . Girls don' t play electric guitars . On top of Old Smokey - All covered with snow - Covered with slow I dumped my poor sweetheart For screwing too slow\par
That' s not funny , Miss Larkin . I can teach you to play the guitar , but you' re gonna have to -- Excuse me , what are you doing ? Excuse me ? Excuse me , I don' t think you ought to do that right now . Turn that off , please . Turn it off . Hello ? Happy birthday , kitten . Hey , Daddy .\par
I saved you the best piece of cake , the one with my name on it . - Know why ? - Tell me . Because guess who ruled the school talent show . - You ? - Yeah . Well , me and David Bowie . But when are you gonna get here ? The cake' s gonna melt and Mom says there' s no room left in the freezer . Well , I can' t , kitten .\par
I got -- I gotta stay late tonight . I' m sorry . I' il be by tomorrow , promise . I only have a few minutes , though ... ... so why don' t you let me say hi to the other kitten . Marie' s out with her friends . What , you didn' t wanna go ? - No . - Okay . Well , give her a pet for me . I love you , kitten .\par
Love you too , Daddy . Yeah . So wacky though , right ? - No . I could do all right . - Right there , that' s right . - You gonna go dance ? - I don' t know . - You like it strong , don' t you ? - Yeah , I like it ....\par
